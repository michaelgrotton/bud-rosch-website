My family is planning a wonderful Birthday party for my ninetieth birthday.  Everyone is coming   including my sons-in-law and two prospective members, altogether there will be seventeen of us.  Many of them are coming from a great distance which I very much appreciate.  I hope that the food and wine will be some compensation for their travel.  We will be having a private dinner at our best Italian restaurant Friday night, a workout for all with my trainer Saturday morning and an all-out lunch featuring imported smoked Salmon and Bagels from New York.   Saturday evening will be the climax with a great catered meal at our house.  Needless to say, there will be an assortment of fine wines.

I will be surprised if someone does not think, "this could be his last big Birthday", don't bet on it.

Someone said that Family is by far our greatest joy and accomplishment, I agree, everything else is unimportant compared to it.  It is my greatest happiness.  I can think of no greater gift than having everyone celebrate with me.

I am only in my early nineties, or I will be December Fourth when I start my tenth decade, three decades more than the Scriptural limit of three score and ten but not as old as Methuselah and Noah when they died.  The Government gives my life expectancy at four years. Government data also shows that there are approximately 115, 000 people in this country 100 or over, almost all women, I apparently have a six-year window, not too comforting but everyone knows that you can't trust the government.

Quoting Casey Stengel, "Most of the people my age is dead.  You could look it up".  I have a picture on my desk of four of us at a High School reunion a few years ago, two of us are dead.  The thought comes to me many times, frequently in the middle of the night that most of my older friends and relatives are long gone.

I am in surprisingly good health, the last time I was in a doctor's office the nurse kept asking me the secret of my long life, could be those Martinis, or giving them up forty years ago.  I don't take any pills, that always calls for a second inquiry in spite of the fact that I answered no medications on the office questionnaire.  Yesterday I fell and broke my nose and cut my hand but they will heal quickly.

Now that my Birthday is only a few weeks away I am receiving more and more attention.  "You are 90, I can't believe it, you don't look 90".  Their comments are flattering but it makes one feel like you have two heads.  Not all of the comments are flattering, the flight attendant who offered to call a wheel chair, the offhand remark, "do you still drive" or "can I get you a chair".  There is a prejudice with age, People seem to think that older persons may not understand, one may have to speak louder or repeat oneself and that they are not as strong and may need some help.  Roger Angel in his essay *This Old Man* notes how people tend to skip over your comments and opinions and seem to be thinking "Holy Shit, he's still standing".

Society used to think that Wisdom came with age.  I can lift a hundred and fifty pounds and run six miles, my Trainer thinks my squats are awesome, my wife's trainer thinks she is amazing, so do I, but I do admit to those senior moments and occasional stagger.  I know that Scientists have found that the body and brain deteriorate with age but it is also true that some of us start at a higher level.  I really want to be treated like everyone else, but I guess that it's not possible.

Old age also attracts the Marketers, my mail box always has at least one bulletin for a nursing home and hearing aids.  Ninety must generate another mailing list.  I recently received an offer for a FREE Final Wishes Organizer.  F**k You Charles F, Snyder Funeral Home and Crematory.

I may be the luckiest man you know, life has never been better.  The kids are behaving well and so are the in-laws and grandchildren.  Our health is good and there is enough money in the bank and we have very generous children.  Every muscle in my body cries out when I get up at night to go to the bathroom and Donald Trump bothers me but those concerns pale in comparison to those despicable bosses in the past.  I do miss the great joys, falling in love, the births, the graduations, the grandchildren and lots of other wonderful celebrations.

Someone said, "Life begins at 90".  Good to know. I am Looking forward to Reykjavik, Tuscany and lots of other trips, the Thanksgivings, Christmas', Birthdays, Marriages? and the unexpected.  I looked at an ad the other day for an Engineer, Think about that.
