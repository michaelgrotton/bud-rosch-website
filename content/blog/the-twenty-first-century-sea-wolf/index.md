He was at mile 7 or 8 of the Cincinnati Flying Pig Half Marathon starting up the big hill, a tired bedraggled bent over old man slogging through the rain and puddles.  The half marathon started downtown, crossed the bridge to Kentucky, came back across another bridge to downtown, climbed a long long hill to Germantown and then dropped back down to the stadium and the finish line.  It was close to eight o'clock in the morning, a dull dark wet dreary day with only a few spectators, probably those with friends or relatives in the race.  Some applauded and had signs; a few probably wondered why the old man was there.  There were less and less runners around him as he drifted towards the back of the pack.

He was tired, wet, soaked, saturated, there must have been a half pound of water in each shoe. The hill terrified him.  His thoughts had gone from" try to go a little faster" to "just keep going".  Soon he would be at "I'll never ever make it".  A few of the runners going by were asking "Are you all right", he wondered if Maggie had put a sign on his back, watch out for my father. He kept replying I'm good, I'm good" but it was a little embarrassing.  He knew that there wasn't any sign but it was in to the second hour and his thinking wasn't clear.  His son-in-law, who often lacked diplomacy, had previously told him that he really did look rather sad when he ran.

Fatigue was setting in, his mind was all over the place, sometimes all he could think about were the aches and fatigue, then he would go blocks and not remember a thing, and then he would start thinking about Maggie, his first child.  She had invited him, talked him in to the race.  There were twenty six thousand runners in the race, he was one of the oldest and would come in close to last but he was pleased that he could still race and it was nice to do be with Maggie.

He had not analyzed his relationship with the children until recently. They were very good to him but they had been gone for years.  They no doubt were more concerned about their relationship with their husbands and teen-agers than they were concerned with their relationship with him.

As I noted, Maggie was the first child and a precocious adult.  Good grades, changed jobs every few years, a great husband, beautiful kids, back for a Master's Degree twice, now starting a bread business, on and on.  His family was ever so slightly afraid of her; and they often said she was a little wild.

That's the background on Maggie.  He had worked long hours and travelled.  His wife was a full time mother, energetic, enthusiastic, bubbling, outgoing, loving, and caring, easily the biggest influence in Maggie's life.

Thoughts of mortality after his recent cancer operation had started him thinking about all of his relationships.  Those long lonely nights generate those thoughts even more than the long lonely runs do.

Before I tell you more about the relationship, let me tell you how he found himself at mile 7 or 8.  Race day started when the alarm went off at four, he ached all over, nothing new.  It was black outside except for the lightning; it was quiet except for the thunder.  He wondered if he should have agreed to enter the race. Maybe they would postpone it.  When he wasn't complaining to himself he wondered if there was some special reason Maggie wanted him to come to Cincinnati or was she just looking for a challenge and wanted to share it.

They arrived a little before the start of the race at six thirty.  It was raining hard with thunder and lightning, dark except for a few street lights with twenty six thousand runners crowded together waiting for the start.  Quite a sight.  He was always intimidated by the idea of running 13.1 miles.  The rain continued, they did not postpone the race.

As I noted previously, he started to think about his relationship with Maggie as he labored up the hill.  He probably never really gave serious thought to any relationship except with his wife and that was beautiful but would take more than a race to describe.

Maggie was a tough, strong, pretty girl.  He remembered wistfully how proud he was pushing her in her carriage; she was a very pretty baby, celebrating birthdays, Disneyland, cheering at swim meets, graduations, her wedding and the babies.  They had their arguments during her teens and when she  partied in college but it was pretty typical.  There was also that jerk that she went around with for a year after college, they didn't discuss him but she knew he thought he was a jerk.  

At the top of the hill his wife was waiting for him, cheering him on which helped.  This was the time when it went from a physical challenge to a mental challenge.

The course leveled out at mile twelve and there was Maggie who had finished and ran back., "You have to run faster to win your age group, that guy from last year is probably right in back of you".  (It turned out he was an hour in back of him.)  It was sort of like she was on Man of War whipping him home in his last race.

The poor guy was close to collapse and Maggie was saying, "just a little faster, the finish line is right up ahead", somewhat of an exaggeration. It seemed like a hundred miles to him.

I have seen the picture of them crossing the finish line, he looks awful, bent over, staggering, grimacing, and she is bouncing along, smiling, successful.

He sometimes remembers the race and his thoughts about their relationship.  The relationship wasn't dramatic, no poet would ever write of it.  He concluded that it was just plain good, they loved each other the way fathers and daughters can.  It made him feel warm and teary.

Afterword - He was first in his age group.
