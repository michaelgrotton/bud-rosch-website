I don't know why my father wants me to write about his life, he is always sending me something he wrote.  My Exceptional Grand Children was my favorite.  This is his story as best I can remember and from what others have told me. I should note that I really do love my father and that he has be a great parent, but, he ain't perfect.

Dad is four per-cent Neanderthal, that is only true for one per-cent of the population.

He was a fairly successful, fairly prosperous happy bachelor age 30 when he met my mother. All of a sudden there was a wedding, and then boom, boom, boom, boom, babies all over the place. (*I should note that we were married in February and our first child was born in December.*)  They bought one of those early VW Beetles so she could commute to the school where she taught.  Four months later mother had to resign, no pregnant teachers in those days. They were no doubt careless Catholics. The happy bachelor was the happy husband and father.

One of my complaints was that I was a darling happy baby when all of a sudden there was another one trying to crowd me out, and another and another.  I love my siblings but there were four of us before I was five, and Dad was an only child.

Right after I was born we moved to Trumbull Connecticut from my mother's home, Springfield Mass.  Trumbull is in Fairfield County, a suburb of New York and wealthy. I am told that Mother was devastated at leaving her family where she had led a sheltered life.  Dad was used to moving, he had moved 10 times before he was 16.

After a short time my mother fit right in.  She was also busy chasing the four of us.  Dad was busy engineering his valves.  Mother and Dad had lots of friends and were active in Catholic Social Justice.  Katie and I started school, my parents were so proud.  We lived in a great neighborhood and my parents still talk to their friends from that time.  The Sixties went by with little notice from us.

The Seventies started ominously, Dad joined the Computer Revolution, his company went bankrupt and he was out of work with no severance.  We were too young to be afraid but he admits to being terrified.  After a couple of months he found a job in Rhode Island.  We moved to Barrington and had a wonderful time.  Our house was two blocks from the beach, we had a small sail boat, the town center was a harbor on Narraganset Bay.  The schools were great, we were all on the Y and school swim teams.  Pattie was the State Fly champ in her age group.  My parents helped start a pioneering liberal parish and most of their friends were from the Parish. It was sort of wild, dancing at Mass, a working priest, the Bishop shut it down after we left Rhode Island and Dad became an Atheist.  Dad had a couple of wild jobs during that time.

We move in the Eighties to Lancaster Pennsylvania when Dad got a job there.  His job had become tenuous and there were almost no opportunities in Rhode Island.  Was I pissed, I had finished my sophomore year and had lots of friends and we were moving to Pennsylvania.  I am still pissed.  Dad worked as an Engineering Manager and then went to work as a Consultant in the Nuclear Industry.  Our lives were all about Lehigh during the early Eighties.  My sister, brother and I were all there at the same time.  Dad forced us to go to Lehigh and study Engineering.  (*That is absolutely not true, it was the best school they could get in.*)  Katie and I lost our scholarship because of poor grades and mother had to go to work in Gimbel's basement selling bras.  Dad is still pissed.  Pattie chose the University of Delaware.  We all graduated in four years.  (Just barely)

I should fill in the time of Dad's life before he met Ma.  He was born in White Plains, New York of a prosperous father and glamorous mother.  The happy day ended three years later at the start of the thirties when their life was destroyed.  My grandfather was out of work most of the time and was seriously ill.  Dad had a precocious start in grammar school but that did not last.  The good Sisters thought he was a pain in the ass and he did not hold them in high esteem.  He was quite active in the Scouts; his Eagle badge hangs in his den.

The Forties were good and exciting for Dad.  It was a slow start, he had a happy high school with mediocre grades and less success in athletics.  He worked hard as a Laborer during the summers and on Rail-way Mail at Christmas time.   Right after High School he was drafted and went to Lehigh on the GI Bill after the army.

The Fifties were when he started his career, earned his Masters and met mother.

The Nineties, the Oughts and the Teens were a time to enjoy life with mother, me and my siblings and our husbands and grand-children and for traveling, running, and writing except when we lost Caz at 9/11.
