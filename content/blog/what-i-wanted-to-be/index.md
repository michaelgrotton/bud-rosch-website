Strange how well I remember my eighth-grade Guidance class in Ossining and having to write about what I wanted to be.  I do not remember being very interested in the future, my eighth-grade was a happy island surrounded by too many sad years, I was happy with "now".  There is a New York city station on the Web that I listen to with an affiliate in Ossining, every time they mention Ossining I get a good feeling.  There were of course other memories of Ossining besides my Guidance class including hockey, football, square root, and Doris.  

I can't remember thinking about "what I wanted to be when I grow up" like a fireman or a cop, I was more worried about my father getting a job.  My choice for the assignment came down to either Forestry or Chemical Engineering and I can't remember which one I chose.  I read an article on Forestry and obviously knew a little about nature and read a glamorous description of Chemical Engineering.  Chemical Engineering is hard, probably why I am a Mechanical, not quite so hard.

I did well in High School math, my family said "you should be an Engineer and go to Lehigh" and I went to Lehigh and became an Engineer and went to work for DuPont.  My "Dream Job" turned out to be Drafting and would not have challenged a monkey.  DuPont and most corporations thought Engineers should start low and work up.  Engineers struggle with Calculus and other esoteric courses and we almost never use them. College may have been more technically challenging than most of our jobs.

I earned a Master's Degree at night at DuPont and quit after a couple of years and never looked back. It is interesting that I ended up an almost Chemical Engineer and my hobby was hiking and camping, I spent a lot of time in nature, more fun than Engineering but not nearly as interesting.  Engineering and Management became more interesting and challenging, I almost diverged in to a PhD program but concluded that industry was more interesting, paid better and worked to retirement.

Here I am in retirement taking courses in writing, challenged, enjoying the process and perhaps with talent but time is running out.  When I started college, the Dean interviewed each one of us, he thought I should take liberal arts, I had a D in English and an A in Math at the time.  I came to where two paths diverged, I took the harder one.  

I sit here wondering about the other path, I'll never know.
