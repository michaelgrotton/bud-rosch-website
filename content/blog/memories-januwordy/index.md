The years cascade down, the memories swirl around me.

They took away my stuffed rabbit and we moved in the middle of the night, my earliest memory.

An early Christmas, my Father bought a goose for dinner, they did not know how to cook it, big fight.

A few years later every gift I hoped for including a two-wheel bike and a B-B gun, a good Christmas.

I was an Altar Boy at a Midnight Mass and then they gave us an expensive winter coat, a good Christmas.

Too many not-good Christmases, we were poor and there was a lot of bitterness.

The eighth grade at Ossining High School, good friends, the pond froze and we had great times skating and playing Hockey, broke my thumb.  Mother and Father had a job.

Harrisburg High School, a happy time, school was good, lots of jobs but hard work, girlfriends, waiting for Uncle Sam.

Sam called, in the Army, crazy time, 35 days on a troop ship, landed in Tokyo, fun and home-sick, lots of friends, miss them.

Lehigh, overwhelming at first, then hard work, good friends and good times.

The Big Memory, Judy, marriage, the kids born, surprised.

Helping Judy raise the kids, being an Engineer, Trumbull, Barrington and Lancaster.

Here we are at 1837 for over forty years, kids are gone and had kids, we see them and delight in them all. Life is good, could not be better except our bodies, mine is 91 years old. Everyone says Judy is awesome.
