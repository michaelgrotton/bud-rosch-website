I was sitting in Starbucks when I looked up and saw an interesting young woman.  She was sitting cross legged on the bench studying a large book, her chin resting on her hands, then hands on her shoulders, one hand down on the book, her hand keeping time with the music, one foot down, both feet down, flicking her hair, chewing her fingernails, her expression remains serious, looks into the distance, she finally says the hell with it and left.  I can relate, sitting in front of a text book that you have to study but the stuff is so damn boring, telling yourself, you have to learn this stuff for the test tomorrow.

Susan, the name seems appropriate, did not readily fit into a niche, it took me a long time to decide her age and place.  She was short and stocky, long blonde hair, attractive, dressed in flowered pants, a peasant blouse, black bra, sandals and a hand bag.  Not a teenager but not too much older, not a business woman and not a house-wife, turns out she is a student.

I studied Susan's features, the words severe and conservative comes to mind.  Her mouth was small and straight, no smile, petulant, serious, not looking for romance. Young men must have to approach her warily, she has a sort of this is who I am,  I don't do flirting and giggling, if you are not interesting. run along.

All of a sudden, I could not stop thinking of Rita, the last time I saw her was the end of our second date when she called me a son of a bitch.  That's another story, I moved away but I heard later that she went on a skiing trip with a friend of mine, broke her leg, convalesced at his place, partied, got pregnant and married my friend. Those days gentlemen "did the right thing" when their girl- friends became pregnant, also in those days some ladies used pregnancy as a trap.  I don't know if Rita trapped Jeff but I think that she was not above it.  Better him than me.

Susan seemed like my old, "acquaintance", capable of doing whatever is required to accomplish her goals and don't get in the way.  She strode purposely on the way out carrying a Micro Biology text and drove away in an old Honda with a bad paint job, a Health Services student in her late teens. She will ace her test, be a success, marry well and have a beautiful girl and handsome boy.
