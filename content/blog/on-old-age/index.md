I find it harder and harder to find inspiration from Tennyson's Ulysses, "And though we are not now the strength which in old days moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are -  made weak by time and fate, but strong in the will to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield".

Roger Angell has an article in this week's New Yorker (February 17 and 24, 2014) titled This Old Man.  Perhaps this essay should also be titled This Old Man.

Angell who is 93 starts describing his ailments and conditions, and they are many.  I am more fortunate than he is but then again I have 7 more years to accumulate problems which I am sure I will if I live 7 more years.  I think my life expectancy is 6 years.  The Jewish Scripture refers to a limit of three score and ten, I must be in trouble.

Let me digress, it seems quite strange to base one's planning on their life expectancy of six years, that seems so close.  I don't care about 10 year guarantees, we don't need a new whatever because the one we have should last more than 6 years, except I have to include Jude in the planning, she is 7 years younger than I am, she can look forward to 2027 when there should be a devastating world depression according to the Republicans.  I do understand that life expectancies are statistics that apply to a large ulation and that I may very well live past 2027, that seems frightening, have your seen pictures of people who are one hundred.

To go back to my frailties, my skin is a real weak spot, my Dermatologists are always cutting away cancers and I am scheduled for a skin chemo that will strip away the outer layer of my face and scalp causing one big scab, enough to frighten little children.  My elbows are another weak point, I fell 10 years ago when I was on Chemo for my Colon cancer.  My bones were fragile and my elbows shattered, 2 surgeons worked for hours installing a plate and 10 1 Â½" screws in  each arm.  One of the screws is coming loose and I am getting pains in each arm, I may have to have them removed which will be a mess.  It is no longer fun to tell people I have a loose screw.  I am starting to worry about my balance, I should, I have ended up in four different Emergency rooms from falls while I was running.  I am very fortunate that I can still run, I recently ran a 10K with my Son-in-law.  The running makes my body ache, I sometimes do not think that I can stagger to the bathroom at night.  My sight is OK, my hearing is poor, stay tuned for more problems.

Angell goes on to discuss his mind.  Our cognizance starts to degrade in out mid-twenties, it is not hard to realize that there has been a loss, one wonders how much.  Angell describes how he is constantly looking ahead for lapses that he can avoid by using substitutes or changing the subject.  I try to do this but it is not unusual to apologize for a Senior Moment.

I launched into a speech at the Book Club last week on how the author treated old age with almost contempt.  My thoughts still seem relevant although they do seem to be viewed through the prism of my age.  I am not dead, and I am not ready for one of the facilities where children send their loved ones.  Angell describes how he will speak on a subject during a discussion that then continues as if he had not spoken, I also experience this.

 Pretty young girls hold my arm, people defer to me at doors, they frequently ask, "are you alright", Angell says they have that little balloon over their heads that reads, "Holy shit - he's still vertical.

So many of the people that I knew are dead, many of my: high school and college classmates, all those I worked with during my career, old neighbors, it's sad.

Judy and I have just had our 53rd wedding anniversary, it does not seem that long.  I tell her that she has been with me twice as long as she was with her mother.  80 years ago when I was a child does not seem long ago. It is hard for me to realize that this was long before most people were born.

The children have been gone for almost 30 years, I have great difficulty remembering that they lived here and filled our house.  They have been so good to us.  I know they worry about us.
