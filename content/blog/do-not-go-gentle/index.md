>Do not go gentle into that good night <br/>
>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br/>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</br>

I have been drawn lately to Dylan Thomas' poem on death.  Thomas is said to have written the poem when his father was becoming blind and dying.  The poem expresses his feelings that his father should fight and rave against his death.  The poem words and rhyme paint a strong vivid picture.  My preoccupation may be because I have been closer to death than many and am nearer than most, I will be ninety on my next birthday.

Thomas calls it a good night and then suggests that we should not go there gently.  To some the good night is Heaven, to others it is simply peace, to some it is a rest stop to another chance at life.  Some, suffering and in pain long to go gently in to that night.  

I remember nights in the hospital after my cancer operations wondering about death.  There was no feeling of rage, my thoughts were of gratitude for a good life.  I have volunteered for many years at a Hospice in-patient unit and have interacted with many dying patients.    A few young patients have understandably raged when leaving their family but most patients seem to accept death and go gently in to that good night. There is also little evidence that raving and fighting our diseases slows death.

A 2007 movie, The Bucket List is about two terminally ill men who escape from a cancer ward and head off on a round the world trip with a wish list of things to do before they die.  A current movie, Going In Style is the story of three old men who rob a bank.  These movies may trivialize death but there may be a message for me here.  I wonder if I should try to lift 50 pounds more, run faster and further, write more and better, travel; or get a faithful dog and sit in the sun-room watching TV.

When death is inevitable, after a very good life with my beautiful wife and family I will go gently in to that good life

**This was my first ending, it seems awkward and too dramatic.**  

There is a yellowed copy of an essay by Dr. George Sheehan, an older runner and writer immediately above my computer.  He writes, *"Though much has been taken"*, wrote Tennyson in Ulysses, *"much abides.  We will live and endure.  We know better than any others how dull it is to pause, to make an end, to rust un-burnished, not to shine in use.  I do not intend to pause, or rest, or rust.  I will survive."*

"I will survive, I will strive to seek, to find and not to yield*" until death is inevitable and then after a very good life with my beautiful wife and family I will go gently into that good night.

\* To serve, to strive and not to yield is the motto of Outward Bound.
