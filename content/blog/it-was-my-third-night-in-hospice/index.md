It is my third night at Hospice,

They say that my cancer has metastasized,

The end is near, no hope.

Their job is to make me comfortable, keep the pain away.

I go in and out of sleep,

The morphine confuses my mind,

My wife is sleeping on the couch,

I hear her snoring softly.

I know that our kids will take care of her but I worry.

I hope that she remarries.

The lights are muted,

One occasionally hears the staff in the distance.

Hospice is quite beautiful, not like a hospital.

Large rooms, tasteful furniture, pretty pictures,

Private decks, landscaping, a beautiful rose garden

<br/>
<br/>

The nice young doctor comes in each morning,

"How are you feeling, any pain, are you moving your bowels?"

I am too afraid to ask him when I am going to die.

He doesn't really know anyhow.

The chaplain comes in later.

He is pleasant and cheerful.

He has his Bible and he knows that I don't have his faith.

I am registered as a Protestant, no denomination.

We trade platitudes.

The aides come it to bathe me and change my pants.

Why am I embarrassed?

Funny, we come in and go out red, wrinkled and messing in our pants.

They roll me back and forth and change the bed while talking cheerfully.

They are all so sweet and caring.

The kids brought the dog in yesterday,

Made me cry.  

I don't know what to think or do,

Sometimes the morphine just knocks me out.

Other times I wonder where I am going.

Probably no place,

Wish I had the faith to see heaven.

Should I say an Act of Contrition just in case?

Can you believe that my fat ego still survives?

I wonder about my Memorial,

What will they say, how many will be there?

My mind keeps going back,

I grew up on a farm, honors at Wharton, married my sweetheart, a boy and a girl, sold flooring like
crazy, great success,

A short time in jail, Alcoholics Anonymous, retired to Hilton Head.

It's so hard knowing what to do when there is nothing you can do.

The thing that bothers me most, there are so many things I still want to do.
