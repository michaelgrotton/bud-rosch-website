President Donald J. Trump is trying to deceive the American public.  He has now lied to us over 7500 times since his Inauguration.  Reviewing his comments and tracking his lies has become an obsession.  Google lists over a thousand pages of web sites for "Trump Lies". The following are some of the titles.

> Politifacts, 11 pages of lies
> 2015 Lie of the Year
> Trump, "I could lie and they (the Republicans) would still eat it up."

> Hash Tag, #Trumplies
> Trump stuns with his lies and ramblings and nonsensical rants in a bizarre Cabinet Meeting
> We cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of History by an American President

Unbelievable, I cannot tolerate his lies, I change the station when he speaks. One thinks that he must have a neurological problem, he must be crazy.

Many New York commentators and celebrities who have been familiar with Trump for years say that this is Trump, he lies, exaggerates, will say anything to suit the occasion. Trump has built his Real Estate, TV career and the presidency on these lies.

When I grew up, that was a long time ago, truth was one of the highest attributes, you could commit all sorts of transgressions that would be forgiven if you told the truth.  This was probably a carry-over from the Victorian Era.  I remember my parents and the Sisters in grammar school frequently referring to the truth, "do not tell a lie".

Early in our marriage my wife asked "would I ever lie to her?", I am not sure of my reply.  White lies, what ever they are, usually defined by the person lying are OK.  The early influence of "do not lie" persists in me, I think am mostly truthful but it seems that there are legitimate exceptions.  A friend of mine in order to clear his conscience confessed to his wife of adultery.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.

I have drifted off from Trump to me.  Trump is the President, his lies are important, frequent, and dangerous.  Why does so much of the public tolerate his lies?
