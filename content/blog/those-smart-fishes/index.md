I just became aware of a Scientific American article "Fishes Use Problem Solving and Invent Tools."

It is surely reshaping my ideas, I don't know why this has not
attracted greater attention.  Some fish may be smarter than I am, there are surely many smarter than
Donald Trump.  The statement that they are capable of complex mental calculus shakes me.  I know that they
are using the broad definition of calculus but as someone who struggled mightily with Calculus I am
impressed.

It is an interesting coincidence that my wife and daughter have been reading Soul of an Octopus, A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness.

Biologist previously though that the use of tools separated us from all other animals.  That theory did not last long, researchers have found numerous instances of animals using tools.

Intelligence has been defined in many ways.  Wikipedia defines intelligence as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behavior within an environment or context.  The definition continues, Intelligence is most widely studied in humans but has also been observed in both non-human animals and in plants.  The latter conflicts with the Bible and beliefs in many religions.  Sister Mary Grace, my Sixth- grade teacher used to go on and on that we were different from animals because we had Intelligence, she said that she could not define intelligence but she was sure we had it and the animals did not.  I recently attended a presentation on the growth of trees and woods.  Research seems to confirm that trees have limited intelligence.

The idea that non-human animals and plants are intelligent indicates that we are all intelligent but that there are degrees of development.  Given sufficient time would all animals develop the same capacity that we have?  Will we develop even greater mental capacity?  One would think that Evolution would result in increased intelligence in all species.

We share 99 per-cent of our DNA with all other animals.  Genes, contained in our DNA and Genome control our life.  This is further indication that we are all basically the same organism and that different species are merely the result of different evolutionary development.

We should be able to develop some time of communication between ourselves and the "lower" animals. I am convinced that some of the dogs I have known are capable of communicating with body language and sounds.  We should be able to increase that capacity.  Imagine a universe where it was possible to communicate with animals with the more advanced capable of communicating complex material. We would have to change our diet, no more eating our friends.

I am semi serious about developing communications with other animals but I am intrigued with the idea.  It is not hard to imagine determining the electrical signals from our and their brains and processing them for communication.  This assumes that animals have more developed thoughts than I am hungry and I want to go outside and I think they do.  Dogs exhibit different intelligence, my daughter Katie has a dog that is nutso, my daughter Maggie has a dog that seems to talk.  Breeding dogs or any animals for higher intelligence seems practical, we will have entered another world when we are able to communicate with other animals and breed them to develop desirable characteristics.  Man's best friend will be a much better companion and also capable of limited tasks.  Dogs could be sent on errands and would be more efficient guard dogs, monkeys and apes could be trained to assemble small and large mechanisms.  Most of our work could probably be done by animals.

Animals doing all of the work is the good part, the bad part, many animals are bigger and stronger than humans and they could decide to supervise us.  Another instance of technology run amok, we better leave well enough alone.
