The lady on TV keeps saying, "I am only in my early sixties", I am only in my early nineties, or I will be in December.  The Government classifies me as Very Old, that is their highest classification.

I am doing relatively well although I only have a life expectancy on average of 4 years and 4 months according to the Government.  Twenty-twenty-one could be a big year but I think I can beat the average, I hope so.  My demise could come even earlier but I don't want to talk about that.

I have only had two serious illnesses, around the turn of the Century I had Colon Cancer, a Colonectomy and Chemo.  A year or two later the Surgeon missed a Cancerous polyp during a Colonoscopy and I developed a tumor and had to have another Colenectomy with an ensuing infection and Chemo.

I visited Chicago for a Christmas treat during a Chemo vacation, fell shortly after arriving and fractured both elbows.  I had a very very bad day at the Rush-Presbyterian before they decided to operate.  A surgeon operated on each arm for 4 or 5 hours and inserted 9 or 10 inch and a half screws.  There were no problems until recently when a screw came loose.  Who else do you know who really had a loose screw.  A surgeon removed all of the screws and my arm is back to normal.

My balance is not good, I have had a number of falls running and ER visists for minor injuries.  Another notable fall was on a visit to DC.  Right after arriving I went for a run along Commonwealth Avenue past the Vice President's mansion.  Just before arriving back at the hotel I fell and hit my face, broke my glasses and hurt my arm.  Off to the Ronald Regan ER at the George Washington University Hospital where they dug out the glass from my cheek and put my arm in a sling.  Ruined another week-end for my wife.

My skin is a financial boon to the Dermatologists.  I had one really bad day when I had a series of operations to remove a cancer on my nose and then plastic surgery.  That and the broken arm day were my two really bad days.

I have been very lucky, two cancers, the broken arms, some falls and skin problems in ninety years are not too bad.  The Medical personnel are always surprised at my good condition and the fact that I do not take any drugs or medicines.  My good health is no doubt a reward for thirty years of very excessive smoking and drinking that I at least stopped 30 year ago.

I do strength training twice a week and try and run 4 miles once or twice.  I recently Bench Pressed 90 pounds and came in third and placed first in my age group in a two and three-mile race in the recent Lancaster Senior Games.  There was limited competition in the Bench Press and none in the races.

I am not sure that even my family is intensely interested in reading about my old age but it seems appropriate to describe my health if I am going to write about my old age.  I have a minor stomach problem but am in good shape for my age and even compared to younger people.  My squat is even famous at the Gym.  I am very fortunate.
