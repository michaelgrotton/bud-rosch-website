I never did hear what really happened to him.  Life here gets smaller and smaller, you lose track of everything except that which you can see and that is not very much.  New glasses and a new hearing aid would help but the world is so fucked up who cares.  The Times print gets smaller, the television announcers mumble, my arthritis drives me crazy.  We only tend to talk about the new nurse with the big boobs and that shit we had for dinner.

You didn't know him until he graduated from college did you?  He was exceptional for as long as I can remember, bright, good looking, athletic and a very good musician.  Our neighbor the coach commented on his athleticism.  He was good at football, baseball, lacrosse, really good at basketball.  If he was a gifted athlete he was a really gifted musician, seriously considered a career in music.  He played the piano, base, synthesizer, drums and I guess anything else that made a noise.  His high school awarded him a prize as the most valuable musician.  Yeah, he was good in academics too, and received an academic scholarship.

Of course he had a girlfriend, probably attracted half the girls in the school.  She was a pretty girl, very good family and seemed very fond of him.  He went to dinners at her house and even went on vacations with the family.  I suppose their relationship was typical young love.  You know more about that than I do.  Do you know how long it has been since I was sixteen?

He decided to go to a city college, I thought he was a jerk for not choosing my school but he was right, things could not have turned out better.  College got off to a great start, good grades, fun in the city, community service, selection as a dorm proctor.  The romance died, probably not compatible with his very high goals or maybe she found someone she liked better.

One of his professors early on recommended him for an elite program leading to graduate scholarships.  He was selected for the program and then also won an undergraduate scholarship for study in China. As I said in the beginning, he was exceptional.  When he graduated he received a number of awards and a prestigious scholarship for additional study in China.  That is when I started to lose track, he was seldom home and even that was a long way from here.  

Someone told me that it was a CIA set-up all the way.  His old man spent a lot of time consulting at factories in Lapland and Mongolia but whoever heard of factories in those places.  He would have had more money if he was into diamonds or drugs, so he must have been government, probably CIA.  The kid would have been a great candidate; they must have worked it out.

The person I talked to seemed reliable.  He said the kid went to China, excelled in his studies, no surprise and went to work in the embassy.  His scholarship required government service so it was natural to go to the Embassy.  Incidentally, I hear that our embassies are full of spooks with vague titles.  The story is that after a few months he suddenly turned bad, partying constantly.  He even picked up with some Chinese woman who was a Colonel in the Chinese army and they had a torrid affair.   If he really was a spook he must have been pumping her for secrets but it turns out that she was in the Chinese CIA equivalent and working on him.  One day he disappeared, presumably the Chinese government threw him in jail to get as much out of him as they could and then sent him off to Siberia and threw away the key.  Everyone denied everything.  

I also heard another story about his time at the embassy.  He applied himself, accomplished any task that he was assigned and was noticed by the ambassador.   He would be assigned to work at parties, entertaining dignitaries and helping whenever asked.  One day he was assigned to escort a prominent Chinese family around the capital and was attracted to the daughter.  She was really pretty, charming and the attraction was mutual.  After a short courtship and with everyone's blessing they married in one of the most lavish ceremonies in Beijing history.  The family was one of the wealthiest families in China, but crooked as a stick.  The kid fell right in and loved the life.  They travelled all over in the family jet from country to country and mansion to mansion.  They even had three lovely children.  He knew that this life would have been condemned by his family so he wrote that he joined a Buddhist monastery and they never heard from him again.

Holy shit, the nurse just called, he's here for a visit.
