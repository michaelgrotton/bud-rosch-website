Ever heard

Of a lovesick

Weight Lifter?

<br/>

Our Trainer's in Love,

Ridiculous.

He's forty-nine.

<br/>

She walks by,

He wags his tail,

Really.

<br/>

Old guys,

Imagination,  

Thank God Viagra.

He's whipped,

Needs help,

Big job.

We can do it,

Skillfully and

Efficiently

Optimize him.

<br/>

Great girl, lucky guy,

Wish them well,

Happy Ever-after

Sharon and Russ,

<br/>

From Bud and Joe.
