I can hardly remember my father, cannot picture him, cannot remember his voice.   

He was a good guy, I loved him, have his genes. He made great sacrifices for me, loved me, and was embarrassingly proud of me, and I can hardly remember him.

It would hurt me if my kids did not remember me. I have been trying to remember him since Father's Day when I realized that I hardly remembered him.  I take comfort that when he died he loved me and my family and I am sure that he is watching us, knows that I want to remember him and helps us through the bad times.  

A friend of mine said that men were not close during my childhood, women, or nannies raised the children and men supported the family when I told him of my concern.  That seems like too simple an explanation.  My Father's and my history provide additional explanation.

Father grew up in a middle-class home in a suburb of New York City, dropped out of High School, joined the Army and went to war.  He was in three battles, was promoted to First Sergeant, served in the Occupation, came home started a successful career in Florida Real Estate, married a beautiful girl and had a baby.  Then everything crashed, the Depression started, he lost his job, and was mostly out of work for the next ten years, almost died from an infection and had no money.  I still remember his fights with my mother and the constant unhappiness.  World War II started, he got a modest Civil Service job and watched the Philies.  After some pretty good years he died at Peace.  It always seemed to me that the Depression took all of his ambition, he was happy to just survive, Mother was not.

I did not have a happy childhood.  We were poor and unhappy and moved ten times.  I was an only child, went to my room after supper and read or listened to the radio, probably to avoid the unhappiness.  Life changed when World War II started, my Father got a job and I was able to get good part-time jobs.  After high school I was drafted, went to college and moved from home.

The best time that my Father and I could have bonded was during my early years but that was when he was desperate to maintain our home.  When the War started we were both busy and frequently away from home, then I was drafted and left home. Circumstances made it impossible for a close relationship, there were not many memories to remember.  It is also true that as my friend said, men then were not close to their children and the fifty-five years since his death have not improved my memory.

Looking at our histories and the culture during my childhood the reason that I do not remember my father more was probably because there was not too much to remember and that's OK.  He loved me and provided me with my needs for the future at great sacrifice and that is far more important than us bonding.  He was trying to survive.

I will probably see my Dad in a few years, I will tell him that I love him and thank him for all that he did.  We will be together again.
