A recent copy of our local newspaper had a front-page article showing a picture of a Charlotte consensus on what God looks like.  The picture showed a thirty-year old Anglo-Saxon male, one would have thought that the God of the universe would have looked more imposing.  I would have agreed with the typical representation of a big guy with a beard wearing a white robe.

The picture looked remarkably like my friend Charlie.  I met Charlie when I was working in Pittsburgh at night school.  I was taking some post-graduate courses at Pitt and ran in to him at a Shadyside diner.  Charlie was laid back, soft-spoken and easily the nicest guy I ever met. He was always vague about his background and business.  He said he was doing some research for his father, he used to joke that he had to do the research because his father was in another universe.

When we would party all of the girls were attracted to Charlie and would gather round him, made the rest of a jealous but Charlie would never let them get very close, someone said he was too shy, had no balls.

In retrospect I wonder if maybe Charlie was a God, sort of fits with his image and personality.  Some Astronomers have theorized that there are other Universes, maybe Charlie was really doing research for his Father for a new Universe. Our Universe is so vast and hard to fathom that I suppose anything is possible.  As far as girls go, who knows how Charlie was equipped. The Bible in Genesis Six describes how Angels looked down on fair maidens and mated with them.  Some believe that their descendants still exist. If Charlie was so endowed the rest of us would surely be disappointing to any girls he favored.  There would also then be a proliferation of Gods, Saints and Angels causing a great deal of confusion.  Then again, the Greeks had many Gods but they did fight with each other.

It's too bad that I lost track of Charlie.  Some day I may go down to Charlotte and see if he is there although Charlotte does not seem an appropriate place for God to settle.
