I am writing this to get these thoughts out of my head.  If you have received a copy you may not wish to read it, it is cynical and may not be correct.  Your Delete button is close.

Our family recently vacationed in Tuscany.  There were fifteen of us including all of the children, three grand-children, in laws and cousins.   We stayed two nights in Florence and then a week at a luxurious Villa, toured the area, ate sumptuous meals and had a wonderful time.

I want to write my impressions of Florence and Tuscany although I suspect that the comments on religion may not be shared with the rest of the family.

The rolling hills and farms of Tuscany are beautiful and memorable, fields of wheat with vineries and olive groves.  The farms are large and appear to be farmed efficiently with large equipment.  The villages were neat and modern and seemed nice places to live.

The cities were Medieval and similar, walled cities built on top of steep hills with town squares dominated by "magnificent" churches.  The streets and squares were filled with shops and crowded with tourists.  The motor-cycles, taxis and trucks were a menace. The Gelato shops were not surprisingly my favorites.  I found their pastries dry and ordinary.  Parking was a problem, Sienna built a garage at the base of the hill to the town and built an escalator that must have rose 900 meters high to help alleviate the problem.  The homes and apartments had large wooden street-level doors and windows above but there were no signs of life.

The churches, many dedicated to Mary must have dominated Medieval Tuscan culture. Pisa's church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, Baptistry, Cemetery and Tower were to me the largest and most impressive of these churches.  Saint Peter's in Rome is the only church I find more impressive. The church is located adjacent to the gate in the wall surrounding the city.  The first building is the Baptistry, a large circular building, maybe 50 meters in diameter and 50 meters high constructed of alternate layers of black and white marble in the Moroccan style. Baptism was required to enter the church, those being baptized enter through a side door and exit through the front door.  The inside of the church is bare except for a large plain baptismal font and a truly magnificent pulpit about 5 meters high and in diameter with ornate carvings, some carved by Michelangelo.  There were only a few small stained- glass windows which was typical of the churches we visited.  Church art in all of the churches seemed confined to sculpting and the painting.

The church, inside and out was magnificent, it would be hard to overuse the word magnificent.  The fa√ßade was huge and ornate with beautiful statues and symbols and large ornate doors.  The interior of the church was huge, my guess 200 meters by 50 meters with a high ornate altar in a raised area reserved for the Bishop, priests and choir in the front of the church separated from the faithful by an altar rail or chancellery.  There were numerous side altars and chapels with relics dedicated to various saints in addition to the great high altar.  The additional altars were required for the large number of priests who wished to say daily mass.  Another very large beautiful pulpit dominated the interior.  The church was filled with beautiful paintings and statues.  A large ornate beautiful pulpit with ornate carvings similar to the Baptistry pulpit seemed to dominate the interior.  The small amount of very plain seating seemed at odds with the rest of the church.

The famous Tower was at the rear of and separated from the church.  The Tower was somewhat ornate, about 20 meters in diameter and 250 meters high and did lean.  The original foundation was inadequate and resulted in the "lean".  The Architects tried to correct the lean originally by balancing the structure and recently reinforced and balanced the foundation to prevent any future failure.  The bell tower seems to be part of the Italian culture.  Most of the churches and many of the towns had bell towers.  The "Italian" church in White Plains where I grew up even had a tower.

The Cemetery was located on the side of the church and consisted of a large building about 200 meters long and 100 meters wide with a large open grass area the size of a foot-ball field in the middle.  The floor was filled with burial vaults for the wealthy and famous, the center was reserved for everyone else in unmarked graves.  The interior outside wall was filled with beautiful (and a few creepy) frescoes.

Another building of note was the ancient Hospital, now Museum adjacent to the Sienna Cathedral.  It was a very large multi-story building with chapels and many beautiful paintings.

We visited the small town of Lucca that had 128 churches at one time.  The church that we visited was founded by Saint Frigidian who came to Lucca and founded 28 churches in 28 years, according to the guide.

Reading my descriptions of the churches one might think that they were like any other church.  The difference is the size, the brilliant architecture and the beautiful sculptures and paintings.  They also have turnstiles and charge 5 or 6 Euros.  I found little religion in my visit, the churches, altars, paintings and sculptures were testaments to rich and powerful Cardinals, Bishops, and famous men.  The emphasis was to Mary and to legions of Saints unknown to me.  The raised fenced off altars, thrones and pulpits and finery reflected in the paintings were to glorify the clergy, not God or Jesus.  The electric votive candles relics, and throngs of tourists did not inspire religious feelings.  The Tuscany churches are for tourists.
  
There was so much of Tuscany that was not described or discussed.  Wikipedia describes Florence as the commercial center of Italy.  I am disappointed that we did not hear more about Trade, The Renaissance, Inquisition, Black Death and birth of Italy.
