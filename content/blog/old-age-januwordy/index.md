I have just finished rereading Roger Angell's prize-winning essay "This Old Man" published in 2014.  Angell was 93 when he wrote the essay.  I usually find encouragement in the essay but today I am discouraged.  It is a dark, rainy day, the snow is melting to slush and I am not feeling well.  I am ninety-one and have been blessed with exceptionally good health except for two Colon cancers but my good fortune seems coming to an end.

I started this Essay last week, today the sun is shining and the slush has gone although more is expected tonight.  My exceptional good health has left me, my walls have come tumbling down.  A few week ago, I woke in the middle of the night feeling hot, my heart was pounding and I was feeling faint.  We called the ambulance, after a few hours at the Hospital I gradually felt better and they sent me home after a number of tests.  My symptoms repeated at a library meeting, I could not walk, back to the hospital with more tests.  The tests continued, my heart was good, then my brain, it too seemed good.  Now we are pursuing my Gall Bladder, it has been a problem for a year and a half and an operation will probably be required.

During all of the time since my first incident I have felt poorly, hot flashes at night, chills during the day, feeling faint, pressure in my head, my heart pounding, feeling weak, pains here and there and depression.

A couple of months ago I felt great, a real exception to the damage of age, running three or four miles, lifting weights, feeling good, then boom.

I retrieved Angell's essay in attempt to lift my spirits, it usually worked but not this time.  Next, I tried my Outward Bound Book of Essays, it helped but not as much as it usually does.

I am feeling better today, not great but better.  Two Ibuprofen helps more than my favorite essays.  The suggestion that I will probably have a Gall Bladder operation that will alleviate the symptoms is encouraging.  Never Give Up, Never Give Up, Never Give Up.  I will not accept defeat from whatever it is that is perusing me.

Today another conference, another test, I am discouraged, encouraged, old age sucks.
