It was 1947, Spring of my Junior year in high school, the War was ending.  I was a "good" boy, average student, lousy athlete, happy, had friends and a steady girl- friend, life was good.  No one ever thought that I would be a great success, except my mother, I was an only child, and they were correct, I did not become a great success.

One of my friends told me that he had recently started a job reading gas meters Saturdays and that they still had some openings.  It had been a long time since I had an allowance, if I wanted money I had to earn it. I had not had a job for a while and called for an interview.  The supervisor agreed to an interview and offered me a job.

The job was to read residential meters. Houses were grouped  in to routes with a page In a route book to note the monthly reading and instructions to locate the meter.  The meters had five dials indicating the gas used that required some judgement, nothing to challenge a six grader.

After a short indoctrination, I started off with my route book and badge and boarded a bus to the appropriate neighborhood.  I was not a very good conscientious Meter Reader.  Walking from house to house, knocking on doors and reading meters was really boring.  I would cheat here and there and write a reading one could guess from the history or note that there was no one home.  There were a few memorable occasions.

One of my early assignments was to a really poor Black slum in downtown Harrisburg.  Race relations were bad, a cop had been murdered recently.  Some of the houses required going down rickety stairs in to a dirt floor basement, nothing bad happened but It was scary.

Another morning I knocked on a door and an attractive young girl answered.  I asked to come in and read the meter and she said sure with a really welcoming smile.  My seventeen year old testosterone driven imagination exploded.  Nothing happened, I read the meter and left for the next house.  (What a wimp.)

Another time I entered an open basement.  The meter was at the far end of a dark basement in a tough area.  I was at the meter when I heard voices above that indicated a couple was having a romantic moment, some call it a nooner, what to do.  Yelling Gas Man did not seem appropriate.  Not yelling Gas Man might be a really big problem if they heard me and he came running down.  It was OK, I exited quickly and quietly.

 One time a Fox Terrier scared hell out of me, I opened the gate and he was waist high with jaws open.  Not really as scary as my next adventure.

I was to read a meter in a Funeral Home.  The instructions were to go down in to a large garage, through an inside door, down to the end of a corridor, left to a room at the end of that hall,  There is nothing to be afraid of going in a Funeral Home is there?  I went down through the garage and found a long dimly lit hall.  I am not comfortable.  At the end of the hall where I was to turn left there was a room with an open door.  I still remember this clearly.  There was a body in a coffin looking at me, or I thought he was looking at me.  To say this startled me is an understatement.  All of my blood went to my knees, I could feel the heat, this was my evolutionary brain telling me run as fast as you can and get the hell out of there.  Then my intellect came in, there is nothing to be afraid of, it is only a dead body.  It seemed like I debated for ten minutes, are you a man or a coward.  Sort of a coward, I decided that  I could leave without reading the meter but that I had to leave slowly, and I did.  I still remember all of this very clearly.  (I told you he was a wimp)

I concluded that I was not a good Meter Reader, that it was really boring and I quit.
