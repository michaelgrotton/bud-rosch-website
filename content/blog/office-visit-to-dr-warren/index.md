Current;  Feel almost normal, slight flush, slight chills, head a little queasy. Slight head-ache.

Comments;  I had some Gall Bladder pain last night. A few days ago I had back pain when I moved, thought it was a pull from exercise.  Current slight pain.

Left ear hearing off, seem to hear base sounds better.

Like the idea of separating symptoms.

I have a runny nose that seems different.
