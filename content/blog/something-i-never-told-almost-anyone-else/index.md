I am really upset, our instructor in our Creative Writing Class, D. Heller wants us to write about something we almost never told anyone else.  Heller is one of those West Coast Hippies who emigrated to Lancaster, you know he must have a secret.  I do not know if it is true but I have heard that he was a well- known Porn star.  I am sure as hell not going to tell anyone my secret, hard enough for me to live with it without the whole world laughing at me.  

I don't know if Heller has it in for me personally or for our whole class.  He wrote the following in a recent story, "Bud, Victoria, Jane, Liz, Hank and Amos, the six of them hold a secret I could feel it but I didn't know what it was.  Then my mind slipped into overdrive.  What were they really up to.  Could it be no good?  Oh God, I hope not.  I shook my head, hoping to clear my concern."  

The other members of our class must be just as concerned as I am.  Victoria recently wrote of her very very difficult childhood.  I am not sure if that is true, the story I hear, and I do not know if it is true, is that she was a cloistered nun who fell in love with the priest who was her spiritual advisor and left the convent to marry him.  It is said that when she said "I Do" that her hair turned green.

I am suspicious that Hank also has a secret that he does not want to share with the whole world, especially Republicans.  I have heard, and I don't know if it is true that he applied to be a priest when he was young.  During his interview, he disclosed that when he confessed his sins he claimed to using "swear words" to avoid admitting to his real failure, harboring impure thoughts.  Hank was immediately rejected.  The world lost a great priest but gained a great citizen.

Jane was raised in India the daughter of a Lutheran minister.  I don't know if it is true but I am told that she married a Maharaja.  The Maharaja was deposed and they were forced to move to the United States with their pet Mongooses. Jane sells Pot to supplement their income.  Her secret must be awesome.

Liz writes these long stories about her friends travels and her times in Maine.  She never really reveals anything significant about her personal life.  She probably avoids any personal aspects to avoid disclosing her secret.  It seems we are all afraid, it makes one suspicious of why Heller wants to know our secret.  I have heard, and I don't know if it is true that Liz has had three husbands and robbed banks with all of them.  Who knew?
Amos is the only classmate that I have not referenced.  I have not heard, and I think that it is true that he does not have any secrets.  He is a paragon of what a what a Husband, Father and Citizen should be.  I do not know if it is true but I have heard that Trump is going to award him the American Freedom Medal.  I envy him that he does not have to carry a terrible secret as I do.

> Author's Note:

<br/>

> It is fashionable to end stories leaving the reader with some unanswered question as I have done. I feel compelled to tell my secret.
> I was a sophomore in High School and went out on a date with Fran Esposito.  Fran had reputation as "fast".  Bill Davies told me later that Fran said I did not know how to neck.  How embarrassing, I was crushed.  It is all about be a Catholic adolescent, we were so full of guilts that we did not do the obvious if we even knew what to do.  Now you know why I dreaded the world knowing that I was not a great lover.
