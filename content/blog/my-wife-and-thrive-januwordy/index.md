My wife Judy belongs to a program at the local athletic club called Thrive.  She is awesome, lots of people say so, many at Thrive.  Her classes at Thrive are directed by a woman named Elyse, she is an excellent trainer and also takes a caring interest in Judy.  Thrive is similar to most strength training programs, it includes lunges, weights, med-balls, pull-ups similar to most weight programs except the Team concept is emphasized. Judy is 83 but keeps up with the class and does a great job socially.

I have occasionally wondered about the word Thrive, I googled Thrive and was surprised at the numerous uses for the word by different organizations: Thrive Market, Healthy Living, Thrive After Alcohol Aid, Thrive Market, Thrive Global and more.

Merriam-Webster provides the following definitions, *Flourish*, *Prosper*, *To Progress Despite Circumstances*.  Synonyms are Burgeon, Flourish and Prosper.  Burgeon is new to me, the definitions are *Sprout*, *Bloom*, *Flourish*.

It would be interesting to review how Thrive applies to Judy. *Flourish* appears to apply, she has always seemed to adapt to her environment.  In our first apartment she made friends with all sorts of people, different Jewish women from Bridgeport and New York, a crazy nice Greek girl from up-state New York who was her best friend and other local women. We moved across Bridgeport to a house, Judy became best friends with, for lack of better words, a high-class rich woman and Sithy, the old Greek lady from across the street that gardened with a knife and was always waving it around.  Then we bought a house where she developed friendships with a number of neighbors with backgrounds and circumstances similar to our own.  She still maintains friendships with them. Then we moved to Rhode Island where her friends were from our new church and then to friends in Lancaster who were neighbors.  We moved a lot. Judy flourished in all the places, made good friends and adapted to and enjoyed the new environments.  

*Prosper* does not seem to apply unless you stretch the definition but to *Progress in Difficult Circumstances* certainly does.

I like Burgeon, I have never heard of it but the definitions *Sprout* and *Bloom* seem most appropriate.
Looking at Judy and Thrive at her club, she has flourished, learned and conquered the physical challenges, improved her health, made friends with the other members and Elyse and derived much pleasure, I think that is flourishing and Making Progress Despite Circumstances and working at those weights until it became easy, sort of easy.

Judy belongs at Thrive, I knew that before I looked it up.
