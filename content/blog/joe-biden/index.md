Biden said Healthcare is a big fucking deal,

Joe don't know shit.

Maggie's birth, that was a big fucking deal.

<br/>

Fifty years ago, four o'clock in the morning,

At the Hospital, Judy in labor, me in the lobby,

Watching the clock, no one to talk to.

The Doctor called, "a baby girl".

Elevator opened, there she was,

The most beautiful girl in the world,

My wife.

The angels sang, God was smiling,

Sister took her away, "come back later"

Insensitive Bitch

Went to Mass, thank you God,

Smiling, so happy,

Bursting with joy.

<br/>

This is how it started,

We fell in love and married,

Happy, carefree,

Pregnant!

Those were wonderful days,

We danced and romanced

Until Twelve-twenty- eight,

Off to Saint Mary's

On an icy night, and scary ride.

<br/>

This is how it ended,

Three more babies,

They grew up.

We grew old,

And lived happily ever-after.
