I remember the nights more than the days,</br>
So lonely.</br>
Like outer space must be.</br>
No one to talk to,</br>
Sometimes thoughts of dying, not often.</br>
Strange, not afraid.</br>
Thoughts of family, so pleased.</br>

One time in Chicago,</br>
After my arm ops.</br>
An older, short, black nurse walks with me,</br>
So caring,</br>
We looked at the skyline, pretty.</br>
The day nurse says no older short black nurses.</br>
A dream, an angel?</br>
Are angels older, short and black?</br>

In Baltimore,</br>
Hiccups,</br>
Hiccups, hiccups, hiccups.</br>
Night after day after night...</br>
So sore, so discouraged.</br>
Walking and walking down dark halls,</br>
Hiccup, hiccup, hiccup.</br>
Sounds funny, wasn't.</br>

Another time at Hopkins,</br>
In the middle of the night,</br>
A four foot Russian lady Sumo wrestler</br>
Wants blood.</br>
My arm is a mess,</br>
Hurts,</br>
Another needle,</br>
I want to go home.</br>
