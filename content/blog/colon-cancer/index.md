I was out of town for a Memorial and went for an early morning run with my daughter.  I do not normally have trouble running but I could not run for a block without becoming exhausted.  I do not know why I did not remember but this same thing occurred when I had a previous Cancer.

We returned to the Motel.  After I used the bathroom I glanced down and saw a bowl full of blood.  This had never happened, I was terrified, the image persists.

I returned home immediately and visited my Oncologist.  A series of tests and a Cat-Scan confirmed the obvious, I had a malignant Colon cancer.

The Surgeon operated, the Oncologist administered thirteen weeks of miserable Chemotherapy

I had a complete recovery.
