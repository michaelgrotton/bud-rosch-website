I meet with some of my High School classmate on the Equinoxes and Solstices.  We are Class of 1945, that will give you an idea of our age.  I have been working for years to persuade two of them that Climate Change is real and mostly caused by us.

There are many reports on Climate Change and the disastrous effect that it is having and will have.  A November 1918 Government report estimates that there will be more deaths, ill health, a 10 per-cent decrease in GDP, a 25 per-cent decrease in corn and soybeans yield and numerous other problems by the end of the Century.  There is an overwhelming consensus among Scientists that the climate is changing due to the human expansion of the Green House effect and the effect by the end of the Century will be disastrous.

I am writing this because I think my class-mates are typical of many and could provide some explanation of why the Public seems to have little concern for Climate Change and why the current Administration is against any action that could decrease the adverse effects.

My class-mates are bright, way above average, one was a Chemical Engineer and the other a NASA Scientist.  They have finally agreed that there is Climate Change but seem to have no concern for the effects, absolutely no urgency for a solution.  One of my class-mates said that "The Good Lord will take care of us, he always has."  Not so, ask the people suffering from floods, fires, droughts, hurricane, sea rise, high temperatures and more.  The Good Lord appears to be busy is some alternate universe.  I have another friend, young, bright and well read.  He feels that Science will solve our problem.  He is a History teacher.  I tried to persuade him that the actions such as installing reflective devices in the Stratosphere are untried and highly questionable on a global scale.

How come I can't persuade my class-mates and friend of the dangers of Climate Change and the need for action?  Maybe the idea of raising seas covering huge coastal areas, huge swings in temperature, melting pole ice and other catastrophes are just so devastating that they cannot believe it, it is hard to believe, nothing similar for tens-of-thousands of years.  Maybe improving our presentations of the probable future is the answer.

Don't know what will happen, neither do my class-mates, I worry for my Grand-Children.
