He was lying face-down on the side walk.

We were visiting my son and his husband in San Francisco on Christmas and my son and I were going to Glide Memorial Church for the morning service.  My wife, Judy and Fran's husband deferred from going, Glide is a little too "way out" for them.  Glide's mission is to provide for the homeless and is in the center of the Tenderloin district where many of San Francisco's homeless live. The Church preaches Unconditional Love and has attracted a large and active Gay congregation.

The Tenderloin is the center for the large homeless population in San Francisco, many who are mentally ill or addicted to drugs camp on crowded side-walks, scatter trash and some use the streets for their toilet. The city respects the homeless and tries to address their needs but is overwhelmed with their presence and is unable to provide the many social services that are required.

"Glide United Methodist church has been a counter-cultural rallying point since the sixties and is one of the most prominent liberal churches in the United States."  The church foundation runs 87 various social programs and provides almost a million free meals and 6000 shelter beds each year, day-care, health care and much more.

The Sunday service is the core that brings together the homeless and the prosperous to fellowship and attempts to motivates all to a better life. Many visitors continue to worship, volunteer and contribute to the Church.  The church and sanctuary are beautiful and the services are crowded with people from the various social classes.  The service opens with a "joyful noise", the hundred-person choir enters from the back singing and dancing accompanied by the 8-piece orchestra, followed by holding hands and hugging and more songs and a homily and songs, the service is moving, many of us cry, the ushers even provide Kleenex.

We walk up a steep hill to the top of Nob Hill to get to Glide.  Nob Hill may be the epitome of wealth, high rise apartments with their doormen, the Mark Hopkins and Fairmont hotels, the Union League, Grace Cathedral, the Masonic Temple and a beautiful park all looking down to a beautiful view of the city.  We walk across the park by people with their pampered dogs and start down a very steep hill that I found scary.  We continue down to where it starts to level out and there is a man lying face down on the side walk not moving.  Fran assures me that he is probably OK and we continue. Is this a metaphor that we rise to goodness and then descend to ignore our brothers and sisters in need?  Fran was correct, there was nothing we could do or the dozens of people preceding us would surely have helped.  We walked back after church, a friend of the fallen man who was still sleeping was sitting next to him, he had covered the man and was eating breakfast.

I will always remember the guy on the side walk.  There was probably nothing we could do but we, society should not allow our brothers and sisters to descend to such a place.

Jesus told a story to a lawyer of a man who was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers who stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead.  By chance a certain Priest was going down that way and when he saw him, he passed by and went to the other side.  In the same way, a Levite also passed by when he came to the place. A Samaritan, as he travelled, came to the man and was moved with compassion, bound his wounds and cared for him. Jesus asked, "which one of these was the good neighbor", the lawyer replied, "the one who had mercy."

Jesus replied, "Go and do likewise."
