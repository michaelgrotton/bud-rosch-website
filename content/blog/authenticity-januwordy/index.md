Grandson Ian has sucked me into a writing program, Januwordy where you write something each day based on a Prompt for each day.  We agreed on every other day, not easy.  I have not heard from him for a couple of weeks, I think he may have opted out. the dog.  I am currently stuck on Authentic, I was going to write about Trump, that he is the model for not being authentic, doesn't work.  Yesterday, maybe in the middle of the night I decided to write an authentic description of my condition, more difficult that it would appear.

My condition varies, my normal condition, here I am now is that I have a slight head-ache, I hesitate to take a Tylenol, my mind is fuzzy, I keep thinking that it is as if I were swimming under water, a slight nausea is the worst part. My balance is a little off, I hesitate to stand when I am sitting but I am OK to walk, little stagger.  When I get my "attacks" I become so "lightheaded" that I cannot walk, my pulse increases, I have some trouble getting my breath, I lay down for a few hours and my attack goes away, I still don't feel great.  My attacks are scary.

I have had three attacks besides the ER visits, I dread the thought that there will be another one soon.  I am on the monitor that continuously monitors my heart and sends the information to the monitor provider and then to my physician. Monitoring started Wed. Jan. 24 AM.  I am able in addition to send notice of Symptoms, I sent one early this morning noting that I felt light-headed.  I called my Doctor Saturday after an attack, we concurred that we would wait for monitor results before any action. It appears that I definitely have a heart condition, maybe A-fib and that it can be corrected with medicine or a Pace-Maker.  My Doctor appears highly qualified, you can check him at Lancaster Heart Group, his name is Gohn.  My regular Doctor, Mike Warren, great guy is following the "action".  I have not heard from my Doctor since Saturday but I have notified the office of my attacks.

"Light-headed" seems to be the key to my condition, I have been tested for dizziness, I do not get dizzy.

I am pleased that my head is clear enough to write this story.

Authentic was due the twenty-first.  I am late for "Noble" due yesterday, Doom (Woop!) is the word for tomorrow.
