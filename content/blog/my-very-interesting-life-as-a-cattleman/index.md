The story of my life and career in the Cattle Business , and should be of interest to many people.

I started life in an upper-middle class elite suburb In Central Pennsylvania where I was a good student and outstanding athlete. I excelled in Track and was the Football Quarterback.  I graduated from a prestigious university, Notre Dame, where I excelled in Boxing and joined the Navy where I was a Lieutenant assigned to Intelligence and served in various foreign countries, and finally in Washington. I bought a red MG during my Washington assignment, I will leave it to your imagination as to what my life was like as a handsome Navy officer in my summer whites with my red MG.  No doubt there are still a number of formerly beautiful women that remember "Billy."

I left the Navy after there was a small romantic problem and returned to my home in Lancaster Pennsylvania.  After a while, at the encouragement of my Father, I had to get a job.  I expected the world to come rushing to me but ended up working for my Father at the Lancaster Stock Yard to start my fascinating career and family.

My family and their support is one of the reasons for my success.  My beautiful wife and the mother of my children was one of the most attractive women in the area and was named Miss Betty Strasburg.  I have five outstanding children, my daughter Molly was the leader of the pack and was awesome.

The first thing I did when starting my job was to buy boots, good for the image and also for standing in the manure.
