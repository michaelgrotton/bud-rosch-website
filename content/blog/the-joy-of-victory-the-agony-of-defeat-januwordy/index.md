The New Orleans Saints beat my team the Philadelphia Eagles last night, 20-14.

Philadelphia won the Super-Bowl last year but had a poor season and lost their young quarter back to an injury, they were fortunate that Foles, their back-up quarter-back who helped win the Superbowl was available.

To qualify for the Play-Offs, Philadelphia had to beat the Washington Redskins in the last season game, and the Minnesota Vikings had to lose, the odds were quoted at 22 per-cent but the Eagles played a good game and the Vikings lost.

The Eagles were the underdogs in the first play-off game against the Chicago Bears. The game went back and forth until Philadelphia scored a touch-down in the last 57 seconds and led 16-15.  The Bears stormed back and kicked a field goal with 10 seconds left that was nullified by a Philadelphia time-out and would have won the game for the Bears.  The Bears kicked again, an Eagle deflected the ball, the ball hit the upright and bounced off the cross bar back in to the field, the Eagles won.

The next game was the NFC Divisional Round against the New Orleans Saints who had won the Home Game advantage, the Eagles were decided underdogs.  The Eagles opened surprisingly strong and led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter.  The Saints dominated the rest of the game and were leading 20-14 with two minutes to go.  Philadelphia stormed back to the Saints 30-yard line, Foles threw a pass that could have been a touch-down or at least continued the drive.

The ball went through the receiver's hands and was intercepted by the Saints, game over.

The Eagles and their fans were stunned, the receiver should have caught the pass. They were anticipating another miracle finish and then in an instant it was over, the game and the Season.  The camera showed the coach hugging the receiver, they both were crying, later the quarterback came over and hugged the receiver.  The coach and players lost a big game, bonuses and the chance to play for the league championship, instead of anger and bitterness they acted with class, great guys.

The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat and there is always next year.

Games like the Eagles-Saints game are one reason sports and football are so popular, excitement and all out play but accepting defeat like gentlemen.  If only our Government were like the Eagles.
