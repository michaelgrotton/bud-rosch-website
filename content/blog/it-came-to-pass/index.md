And it came to pass that Marriame delivered a beautiful baby girl, mother and child were enveloped in a golden glow.

After exiting the tunnel Agrippa and Marriamme were met by a contingent of Essennes living in Egypt who had been warned of the flight.  The Essenes helped the couple to a sanctuary deep in one of the major pyramids where they provided the best of modern medicine.

All of the Gods were present in an antechamber waiting to celebrate the birth, Yahweh, Bal, Mazda, all of the Greek and Roman Gods and God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  All were amazed to see the Divine Deity travel in three directions at the same time, this related to string theory.

There were in addition to the Gods a large group of beautiful people unknown to the others.  The group exuded peace, confidence and comfort to all.

After a long celebration and Marriames gaining strength, the leader of the mysterious group announced that they were taking the new Messiah Jessica and her family to Airies where she and her twelve consorts would rule the constellation.

It should be noted that shortly after the Assumption the Tea Party destroyed the planet earth from destructive economics, pollution and global warming.  Jesus led the Prophet Obama and the faithful to a beautiful planet where they lived in peace and harmony shortly before the end.
