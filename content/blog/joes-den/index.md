Joe's den might have been every old man's idea of the perfect man-cave, a room covered with bookcases except for a picturesque window with a view of the bay and a 48" TV for nightly entertainment.  Joe loved sitting in his great big Barca Lounge sipping his nightly cocktail, sometimes cocktails.  He even had a Golden Retriever named Charlie lying next to him to complete the perfect picture. This is where Joe would sit by the hour dreaming about retirement, an S-Class Mercedes and not having to see another client and sell another fire-engine.  Selling fire-engines had been good to Joe but it was tough work traveling and entertaining all over the state and he was tired.

Joe's Retirement day finally arrived,  his sixty-fifth birthday was last month, he had completed all of the paper-work for his retirement, attended the going away parties and now he was free, retired after so many years.

He had talked to his wife for years and now he was going to do it, he was so excited and happy he could hardly control himself, he was going to sign the contract for the brand new S-Class Mercedes.

Joe's wife Nora came into the den and said, "Joe, you know, you are not looking well and you seem to be always tired."  Joe answered quickly, I'm good, I'm good, it's been an exciting time and I am coasting down."  Nora answered, "I hope that's all it is but you keep me in touch. That reminds me, you were supposed to check on our health insurance now that you are retired."

"That's on my list honey, I'll do that first thing, you shouldn't worry."

At first Joe thought the pain was from the excitement but it grew and grew until he screamed for his wife to call 911.  The doctor prescribed prescriptions to alleviate the pain and after a series of test determined that an artery near a nerve in Joe's abdomen had irritated the nerve causing the intense pain.  At a meeting with the doctor the doctor said, "Joe, the artery irritating the nerve is likely to fail within hours, you will not survive that failure." Joe was frightened and devastated, he would miss Nora and the kids and he couldn't help but think that there goes the S-Class Mercedes.

The doctor came in the next morning to see Joe, he was pleased to see that Joe was still alive.  Joe asked, "doctor, there must be something you could do to save my life."  "Joe, there is a new operation that requires a team of specialist and requires a recuperation lasting months and there is no guarantee of success.  The operation is also very expensive.  Let me know as soon as possible if you want to try it."

Joe talked to Nora and the kids and checked his health insurance.  The health insurance deductible was equal to the cost of the Mercedes.

Joe opted for life, who the hell needs a Mercedes.

After many months and a tough convalescence Joe was healed, He could often be seen riding around with Charlie in an old Buick, happy to be alive.
