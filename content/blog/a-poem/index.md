We're reading the Oxford Book of English Verse next year.<br/>
How intimidating!<br/>
Not really, I can write a poem.<br/>
No you can't, you're an engineer!<br/>
Yes I can, I'll write all caps and sign it Bud Bud.<br/>
Will you lie?<br/>
No never!<br/>
Will you research?<br/>
Assiduously.<br/>
Will it rhyme?<br/>
Sometime.<br/>
Will it have a plot?<br/>
No it will not.<br/>
Will it have sex and gore,<br/>
Not any more!<br/>
Will you be a great poet?<br/>
If I improve with age and live to two hundred.<br/>
Doctor Russell will say,  a poet you're not,<br/>
Not in 400 years, "please leave the club".<br/>
(no applause please)<br/>
No he wont!<br/>
He is married and mellow and only gives As.<br/>
Listen to me!<br/>
Hear my poem.<br/>

<br/>

## Poem ##

*I LIKE THE CLUB IN THE COLD AND THE HEAT,<br/>
IT'S HARD TO WAIT FOR THE DAY THAT WE MEET.<br/>
THANK YOU DOCTOR RUSSELL AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS,<br/>
I CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT SEPTEMBERS,<br/>
WHAT FUN, POEMS DONE.<br/>*
