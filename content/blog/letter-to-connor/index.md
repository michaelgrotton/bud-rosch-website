Connor, what a coincidence, someone just told me this story. It reminded me of our conversation.

I was waiting for a Pizza last night when I started talking to the waiter.  

The waiter pointed at some guy in the corner that dominated the scene, big good-looking guy, confident, looked prosperous.  The waiter said it was Doctor Johnor B. Cool, I had heard of him.  The newspapers are full of news about him, a revolutionary new brain operation, a visit with the President, appointment to Civic Committees, stories about his personal life.  He is married to an ex beauty queen and they have three beautiful brilliant kids, lives in a Lake Front condo, rides around in an S-class red Porsche.  They also write about how he has saved countless lives with his operating skills, some even want to Canonize him.  I suppose he could be President someday.

The waiter continued, "we were in Medical School together, I knew him quite well.  During our first year we bitched and moaned about the stupid courses we had to take, Anatomy, Biology, Organic Chemistry, what the hell does that have to do with Medicine and treating patients. It was particularly vexing when we saw all those other dudes that did not choose medicine bopping around, party, party, girls, girls."  He said they both resented having to compete against their bright girl classmates instead of romancing them.  Sucks.

"After awhile I could not take it, I quit, Johnor stayed on. The only job I could get was back at this Pizza place where I worked before I went to school. I have been here ever since."

My Pizza was ready, as I leaving the waiter said, "hey, if you know where I could get a job let me know, they are installing robots here and I will lose my job next month."

Quite a story.
