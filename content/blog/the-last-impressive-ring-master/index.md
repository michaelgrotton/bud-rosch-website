I am the last Ring Master on the last Barnum and Bailey Circus train heading to retirement and the peace and contentment I have been seeking all these years.  I have travelled aboard these Circus trains for almost fifty years.  The tedium and monotony can at times be suffocating.  That is not to pretend that there are not times of excitement and elation.  You of course may not choose to share my opinion.  I hesitate to crow about myself but I am impressive.  It is not easy trying to be impressive.  Some have called me "Tiger" to describe my formidable appearance, I am tall, dark, and handsome, with a voice to captivate large audiences. Then again, I deny my bald head, fat stomach and protruding rear-end.

As Ring Master, my job was to control the action in all three rings, a difficult task.  Most performances were routine.  One exception stands out, the time I accidentally backed in to the side of the Lions cage, the Lion's paw hit me in the ass causing me to explode across the ring, it was three weeks before I could sit down.

My memory is fading but I will never forget my liaison with Nanette.  She was like a carrot pulling me on, I feel young again when I think of her, I am sure she frequently still pines for me.  When her lover discovered me, I turned to a favorite trick and escaped wearing a wig and a tutu.  I had been flirting with trouble, her lover was a filthy roustabout.  Not too smart.
