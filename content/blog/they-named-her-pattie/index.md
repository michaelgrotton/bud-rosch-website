The hospital had just called, "the baby has been born, you can come see your wife", at that time
husbands were not allowed in the delivery room.  He hurried to the old hospital, and was walking
down a dark corridor when he noticed a bassinette hooked up to an Oxygen tank, he thought it couldn't
be their baby, not likely, but he was still worried.

When he entered his wife's room it was dark, the smell of Ether was overwhelming, she greeted him
and talked as if the baby had not been born, clearly confused from the anesthetic.  He told her that the
baby had been born and that he loved her and that the kids all sent their love.  He was worried and
hurried off to contact the nurse.  There was something wrong, he did not know what it was.

It was their baby in the bassinette with the oxygen.  Her lung had been punctured during the birth, the
puncture could heal in the next few hours or there would have to be an operation, Yale-New Haven
hospital had been notified and was standing-by.  They would notify him when there was any
development.

It was three o'clock in the afternoon of a beautiful Winter's day.  A neighbor had offered to take care of them until dinner.  Tears still come in to his eyes when he thinks of that time, sitting in his "red-chair" staring out the window.  There was no one close that he could call.  

Would she die, how could he tell his wife or the children, would they have a funeral, would there be a
casket, the thought was overwhelming, what could he do, what should he do, he was helpless, the time
dragged on and on, praying and thinking and thinking and praying, was there a heaven, why don't they
call, why don't they call?  

They named her Pattie, she has just turned fifty.  He still thinks about the "red chair" and cries a little.
