Sleep is one of my best friends, naps in the afternoon in my easy chair, cold nights with heavy covers and at so many other times for so many different reasons.

Sometimes one just wants to tune out.  I had the world's worst boss, that son of a bitch worked at being mean, I would go out to the car at lunch time and scream but my real comfort came at night when I would pull the covers over my head and hide in sleep.  Another terrible time was when I had my Colon surgery and developed an infection and the hiccups.  I remember walking around the hospital corridors in the early morning hours trailing my IV longing to sleep.  I also clearly remember the Doctor waking me after the Colon surgery thinking I made it, I am alive.  I shattered my elbows when I was on Chemo and was in great pain most of the day. I still clearly remember entering the operation room desperate for the anesthetic and sleep.

There are times when our bodies are pleading for sleep and it is not appropriate, I remember clearly a Calculus class, I had stayed up all night studying, fell asleep and almost fell out of my chair.

Many of us have trouble sleeping, there are all sorts of advertisements for bedding, sleeping pills and even for Doctors who specialize in sleep problems.  I doubt that our ancient ancestors had problems sleeping unless there was a saber-tooth tiger prowling around. He must have longed for sleep, cold and hungry, exhausted from running all day, miserable waiting for sleep.

Our recent ancestors did not seem to have problems sleeping or at least did not write about it.  Some had down mattresses and comforters, most had straw pallets with cold winter and sweltering summer nights. Many worked at hard manual labor from sun up to sun down and probably fell asleep exhausted.  What will we do when robots take over all of our work, we may all have to run marathons and swim miles?

Children seem to love sleep just as much as I do.  I look at mothers carrying babies sound asleep in their mother's arms in a noisy market, no lullaby's required, it is also true when they are not tired that they do not sleep no matter how much you rock and sing.

Dogs are also great sleepers, I have read that they ideally sleep eighteen hours a day, they seem to love curling up, occasionally opening an eye to check on things.  No wonder they decided to be tamed and joined man who feeds them and provides a good place to sleep.

Most of us sleep a third of our life, I wonder why we did not evolve to require less. It could have something to do with recharging or that in the ancient past it was dark, there was little to do except procreate and sleep.
