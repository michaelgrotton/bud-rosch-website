From today's NYTimes:  *The north magnetic pole is moving eastward at an accelerating pace.*  Is doomsday near?   No, doomsday is not near at least from movement of the magnetic pole.  The poles move due to the sloshing of the iron core.  The poles even reverse every 200,000 years on average.  Doomsday is near but it will be from Global Warming.

I am far more worried about that idiot in the White House and his response to Global Warming. Why don't those merchants of doom worry about him?  Let me list the ways he can augur the apocalypse; a world-wide depression brought on by his dumb trade policies, we are quite close, a nuclear war where civilization is wiped out, the seventh extinction but far more likely is his lack of action for climate warming.

It is difficult to reason why Trump is so negative to even admitting that humans are the cause of the current crisis.  Some ponder that he is mentally ill, he seems too devious and manipulative for this to be true.  One could claim that he is dumb, he does not read, that those are the reasons he rejects the human cause for global warming.  What ever it is it must be connected to his egotism and greed.

Global warming can best be alleviated by the leadership of the President of the United States who is the leader of the free world.  Why then does not the congress, primarily blocked by the Republicans take the lead?  Apparently, the Senate Republican leadership is so intent on retaining power that it will not antagonize the President.

I would venture that maybe Congress is too dumb and afraid to act.

One of my friends said that the Good Lord would take care of us, tell that to the New Yorkers hit by Hurricane Sandy and all the others hit by hurricanes, the Australians hit by drought and the Californians hit by fire. The overwhelming consensus is that all of these tragedies are a result of Global Warming.

I am perplexed by the lack of concern for Global Warming, why is it not the center of our attention.  The vast majority of scientists predict dire results of Warming, increase of temperatures of two degrees Celsius and an increase of sea levels of up to two feet that can kill millions.  The glaciers are melting, the Pole ice is melting at a rate higher than previously predicted.  Global Warming is happening now, the results will be increasingly tragic.  We are standing watching.
