I have just come from watching John McCain's funeral on TV.  The sentiments were beautiful and motivating when compared to the Trump administration and its crass motives and actions.  McCain obviously designed the service with that in mind.

The picture of the flag draped casket isolated in the sanctuary will remain with me.  I can picture myself in a similar casket without the grand send-off.  My modest Service will entitle me to a flag.

We long for immortality but I do not have faith that there is a here-after. I have been thinking lately of my death, not surprising, I am ninety.  It has been said that the worst part of death is not the actual death, it may even be sudden, but the approach as we slowly lose our mental and physical capacities. As I inch to mortality I find it difficult to analyze complex problems, my mind is not quick, my balance is poor.  

I write, I run, I AM ALIVE.

I recently finished reading a book Searching for Stars On An Island In Maine by Alan Lightman, a renowned Physicist. Lightman discusses at great length why his belief in science leads him to the conclusion that there is not a God or afterlife.  I have come to the same conclusion.  Lightman is a Humanist, He discusses Transcendence, the feeling that there is something bigger than us but writes that his belief in Science contradicts that belief.  My belief is similar, I had great faith in God when I was young but that has disappeared.

There are several scientific theories that I find compelling.  Our Universe is so complex starting with strings of energy that comprise Quarks, Black Holes that swallow Galaxies and Dark Matter   that Astrophysicist theorize occupies eighty-five per-cent of space. Why would a God design that complexity?  The other concept is that the are billions of planets in our Galaxy similar to earth and billions of Galaxies with billions of planets, the idea of a personal God does not seem compatible with that concept. There may be some force that created the Universe but that too seems unlikely.  

We live in a world of unprovability, there are no absolutes, there is the constant pull of science versus Religion.

Back to me in my casket, I wonder if I will die slowly with time to review my life and say my good-byes or die suddenly, will I suffer?  I think that it is important that I realize that Death will come in a few years and that I should make peace with that idea, I do not have to immediately start arranging my papers and writing good-byes but I should lean in that direction.
