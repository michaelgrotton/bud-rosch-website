We went to the Piccadilly Tea Room Sunday, it was decorated with all sorts of British memorabilia, pictures of Princess Dianne, the Royal Family and scores of fancy cups.   I do not see how people can be so attracted to things British.  The British Nobility are not noble, I find them ostentatious, petty, vain and stupid.

The Monarchy exists because of Divine Right, the idea that God has chosen the Monarchs.  I doubt that many people still believe in Divine Right, the British probably cling to the Monarchy to retain the pomp and circumstances and as a reminder of the days when England ruled the world.

The British pay a heavy cost for the Royal aristocracy.  The world suffers from their poor decisions.  The recent movie "They Shall Not Grow Old" illustrates how the poor decisions of the Officers who were selected from the nobility resulted in millions of unnecessary deaths in World War I.  Lord Mountbatten's decision on the Indian border when they were granted freedom also resulted in millions of deaths as did Churchill's decision at Gallipoli.  Princes Phillip and Charles parading around with their ostentatious uniforms hung with medals and sashes is absurd. They did not even serve in the military.

I find Royals personal lives which one cannot avoid, disgusting.  They all appear to be oversexed.  I have read that the Aristocracy's week-end parties were primarily occupied with people jumping in and out of others beds.  Phillip seemed content with his marriage because the Queen tolerated his adultery, Charles who seems really stupid gave up Dianne for some bimbo. There were lots of other scandals with siblings, nephews and nieces.

The family does provide employment for a large number of gossip columnists.

Noble the Nobility is not.  Dictionary.com defines Noble as "having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principals and ideals such as honesty, generosity and courage."  Collin's English dictionary states "if you say that someone is a noble person, you admire and respect them because they are unselfish and morally good."  In no way do the English Royal family meet these standards any more than Trump could be considered honest.

Why am I concerned about the British Royal aristocrats, it is because of the high costs to maintain the Royalty and their selfish judgements that have resulted in millions of deaths and indirectly in the deaths of many others who were not British.
