Remember the old song,<br/>
Don't send my boy to Kappa Sig<br/>
The dying mother said.<br/>
Was it bad? <br/>
Could have been worse, <br/>
But not much.<br/>
Then, a renaissance:<br/>
Diploma, Gilbert, Epri,<br/>
Verisign, Symantec.<br/>
Reading, Zabrovnic, Columbia, Charlotte, <br/>
Alfredo, San Francisco.<br/>
Wait, where is Alfredo?<br/>
It's not a place,<br/>
It's Fran's one and only.<br/>
What's a Fredo? <br/>
It's Italian for well dressed.<br/>

I remember the beginning,<br/>
The four of us off to St. Vincent's<br/>
Look, look, <br/>
A little brother, <br/>
Rather have a new doll,<br/>  
Stop poking him, <br/>
He must have been terrified.<br/>
Later, hockey, football, Nayatt School. <br/>
Lancaster, Rodney, <br/>
The Day Camp, Swim Team, Graduation, <br/>
Off to Lehigh and Kappa Sig<br/>

Fran, we are so happy that you joined us, <br/>
You brought joy to our life<br/>
And help to make our future bright, <br/>
We love you very much, <br/>
Happy fiftieth birthday<br/>

From Your parents with love.<br/>
