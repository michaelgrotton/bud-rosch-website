Supposing Magic Markers were really magic, supposing one could erase some dumb thing you did in the past or prevent some future mistake.  I read a novel recently that described the ability to go back into the past.  The Protagonist was so attracted to the past that he decided to go back and stay, a pretty girl he met in a previous visit to the era was his reason, no surprise.

The proto guy was really upset about a current bad guy, it turns out that he was aware that the bad guy's grandfather met his wife in the time period he was transitioning into when she was coming out of a theatre on a particular night. When he is back in the past proto guy goes to the theater, walks up to bad guy and asks for a light just as Grandma walks by, distracts Grandfather who doesn't see Grandma, Grandpa marries someone else and bad guy is never born.

The Magic Magic marker could sort of work like that.  The first thing I would do would be to go back to Trumps Grandfathers time and send every pretty girl in New York to propose to him and to be extra sure I would send every good-looking guy in New York to romance Grandma.  No Donald J. Trump, I would be a national hero.

There were many times when I was out on a date and acted like a jerk, I could erase those times but those girls probably put me out of mind before they shut the door and went on to better prospects.  There was one time I would like to go back and revise.   I had a brief courtship with a local girl when I was in college.  We wrote to each other when I was home for the summer, she wrote these really passionate love letters. I looked forward to our date when I returned to school, we had fun, when we arrived at her house I asked if I could kiss her, she said "no", I asked again, she said "no".  I was crushed, I am still pissed.  My Marker would have her marry a weight lifter and have 13 children who were seven feet tall.  I had two bosses that were tied for the world's meanest boss.  I would Marker them into Septic Tank cleaning.  Before I forget, I would have to Mark out all the times I could have been a better husband, not too many and they were little things.  Ho, ho.

I am not to sure about rearranging the future, there are those Unintended Consequences.  I was thinking about my Obit. "He Died 3035" but there are times when dead is better.

I would still like to have the Marker, thoughts will arise where correction might be fun but looking at my list of changes it is clear that I have had a good life and look forward to a good future, probably good I don't have a Marker.
