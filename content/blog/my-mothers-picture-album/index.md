This book is actually my mother's album; I have incorporated the pictures into a new book.

The family starts in Newark NJ in the 1890s.  My grandfather was a lineman in the very early days of electrical distribution.  This was a macho romantic occupation.  He worked installing high voltage lines through the South and West.  The linemen climbed high wooden poles carrying high voltage using "spurs". He was knocked off a pole one time and received a medal for rescuing a fellow worker.  As I understand it, he lost his job because he would not join the union and moved back home to White Plains in the 1900s where he worked for the Westchester Lighting Co, later ConnEd.  He retired in the 1930s.

Mary immigrated to the US to work for an uncle and married Eddie. I can't remember my mother's birth order, maybe 3 of 5.  My mother was born in Newark Sept. 12 1901; she died January 8, 1986. The other children were Loretta, Eddie, Albert and Mae. Loretta married Val Hickey from a Brooklyn political family.  She died in the 30s apparently from Cancer.  Eddie married Isabelle, they did not have children.  Albert married Elizabeth; they had an adopted child, Albert and later a birth child John.  Mae married Alfred, they had two children, Molly died from Cancer in her twenties.  Sandy is the only family member I am in contact with and that is only occasionally.

The Lewis' first lived over the livery-stable on Main St. and later moved to a house near there. I am told that Ed's father lost his leg in the Civil War and tended the railroad gate on Main St.  (The tracks were raised in later years)  Ed's family was from Armonk going way back.  Many are buried in the Rural Cemetery on Broadway.  The Lewis family is buried in Cavalry cemetery, same as my mother and father.

My mother went to St. John's grammar and secretarial school.  I would guess that she graduated when she was about 16, (1917) and worked in New York until she married in 1926.  She worked for the NY Central RR Purchasing agent in Grand Central. She talked of shopping in the city and she and my father went there on dates.

The Roschs immigrated to Poughkeepsie NY via New York City about 1850 from Alsace.  He was French, she was German. All of the Roschs were named Frank, later Francis.  He enlisted in the army as a 2nd Lieutenant for the Civil War, became a Cabinet Maker and they lived on Mansion St. He and Appilonea had four Children, my Grandfather Francis, Jacob, Andrew and Margaret in that order.  Andrew settled in New Rochelle, I think Margaret lived near Hoboken NJ.  My grandfather was a candy maker; married Catherine Kerr and they had two children, Raymond and Francis, my father born May 6, 1894.  They moved to White Plains in the 1900s where my grandfather worked for his brother John who was a photographer. They lived at 1 Summit Ave.  My father seemed to have a happy childhood.  Francis, later Frank was very active in athletics and joined the National Guard for their sports teams. Their Guard unit was mobilized for a Mexican expedition led by Pershing before WWI.  He served in WWI rising to 1st Sgt. and stayed for the German Occupation.  He was hospitalized for TB at Saranac Lake after the war and later became a salesman, as best I can tell, he was selling Florida real estate and was quite prosperous.  The dates on the pictures indicate that he dated my mother for 4 or 5 years.  When they married they had a  Buick and a nicely furnished apartment.  This was apparently the peak of their prosperity, from there it was down-hill quickly.  He died Dec. 23, 1963.

My parents moved in to a house on Grant Ave. (No. 7?), I may have been born there, they lost the house and moved to Kensico Ave, I must have been 4-5, there my father caught Erysipelas and was very seriously ill.  At this time the Lewis' moved in to Parkway Knolls, we had to move in with them around this time.  We later move to Howard Ave, I went to Saint Bernard's through Grade 6, we moved to Ossining where my mother managed rentals for a new apartment, my father sold Plymouth cars.  We moved back to White Plains for a year or so and then moved to Harrisburg where we lived at 50 Taylor Blvd. They had a good life until my father died, my mother returned to White Plains, delighted in seeing the children and lived well.

Comments leafing through the album.

I can hardly remember Mary Lewis, a big memory, we were living there, I discovered her dyeing.  I have some pleasant memories of Ed and Barney the dog.  My mother was always fighting with her siblings, she had a close fighting relationship with Mae for years.

My parents Bermuda honeymoon was understandably a big deal.

My mother must have been close to Loretta, she lost contact with Val after a few  years.

My mother and I spent many many days at Rye and Oakland beach on Long Island sound when I was quite young.

I remember my grandmother Kittie but we were not close, not sure why.  Mamie was her sister and lived a few blocks from her.  My Grandfather died when I was an infant.

Ossining was a happy time, my first Scout camp was really fun.  We move back to White Plains for my 9th grade and I went to another Scout Camp.  I made Eagle Scout just before we left.

My father accepted a job at the Middletown Air Corps base at the beginning of the war and we moved to 50 Taylor Blvd., Harrisburg.  I graduated from John Harris in 1945 and was drafted shortly after.  A happy time, my father had a job.

There is picture of me in my State Guard Cavalry uniform, my time riding horses in the Guard was a lot of fun. The last picture is of me with my Hood, was a big deal.

I grew quite nostalgic preparing the album and writing these notes.  The notes are obviously incomplete, it has been 30 years since I talked with my mother and 70 to 80 years since many of the events.  It is obviously difficult to summarize one's early life in a couple of pages.
