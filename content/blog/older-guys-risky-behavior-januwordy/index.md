What is it with older guys that they have to indulge in Risky Behavior, Trump with the Shut-Down, George HW Bush jumping out of air planes and my niece's husband Paul are examples of Risky Behavior?  Nancy Pelosi says Trump is trying to get his Macho.

What was it with Paul that made him decide to learn to drive a Motor Bike, in Nicaragua, with a local instructor, using a local bike, on dirt roads, with crazy traffic?  Paul is an exceptionally bright guy in great shape; a successful attorney, and a strength trainer who has lived all over the world.  Maybe riding a Motor Bike was on his Bucket List?

My Niece writes, "We are still in Nicaragua as Paul had a Motor Bike accident.  He asked a local to teach him which was not a good idea.  He fractured 4 ribs, scapula, He has also had to have a procedure to remove some blood that pooled as a result of the Trauma.  It sounds probably worse than it is, however, we are lucky that it was not worse."

My God, it could not have been much worse, the poor guy.  I fervently hope he recovers.  I would also bet that he continues to do things risky.

I have been trying to think of some of my Risky Behavior, depending on the definition I may have a long list.  Drunken driving, driving under unsafe conditions and driving unsafe cars was certainly risky and friggen stupid.  I am lucky to be alive.  One time for work I climbed into a man-hole that could easily have flooded.  I did some climbing and rappelling and climbed an ice-fall that seemed risky but we had back-up ropes, worked in a Reactor powering down, that seemed risky but was not.  I tried to join the Paratroops when I was in the Army but that did not work out.

We lived on the edge economically, mostly my fault, we never saved, never had 5 bucks at the end of the month until the last few years, friggen lucky.

It was not my intention to write a confession, leave that to Saint Augustine.  

I suppose that we are the descendants of people that took chances, if you stayed in the cave when that damn dinosaur was hanging around you starved.  Those guys that went on whaling ships that spent years sailing around the world risked their lives on every voyage come to mind.  

When something risky arises, there is frequently a group watching, challenging and saying go ahead, don't be a "coward", "chicken", "sissy", "be brave".  Seldom does anyone say wait, that's dangerous.

My kids have probably done more risky things than I did. The Peace Corps in Timbuctoo, Grad school in Caracas, starting in New York all alone, "coming out" are just some of the ones I know.
