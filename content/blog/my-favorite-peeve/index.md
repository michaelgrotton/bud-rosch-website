My favorite peeve is  the so-called writers that write a story and leave the end hanging.  Do they do this to allow us to construct an ending?  I don't read stories to construct endings, I expect the whole story.  The New Yorker Magazine short stories are well known but I can't remember when one of them had an ending ending.  Is this technique because of a lack of imagination, or writer block?  D. Heller recently wrote a story, The Revelation that illustrates this shortcoming, the story ends without telling us what the Revelation is.  What a shame, there are so many interesting ways to reveal the Revelation, the following are a few of the many possibilities.

<br/>

The Acolytes and their leader, Tiffany, the Green Haired Princess of Letters and part time witch, the members of the writing class gathered in the woods waiting for Heller.  Don Heller was to be inducted into the Society of Great Writers as a Junior Novice Laureate.  The group had had ample time to evaluate his talent and after long heated discussions concluded that with work, time and magic they could mold him into greatness.  When Heller arrived, he was stunned to see the class dressed in their crimson robes trimmed with ermine and gold.  Tiffany wore a crown studded with diamonds and was holding her favorite frog.  When Heller found his voice, he screamed, "what the fuck is going on".  Elaine, the group spokesperson, who had morphed into six-foot-six and 225 pounds started to address him. It was difficult to talk to him because he kept passing out, Frank had to throw a pail of water on him every ten minutes.  Heller was eventually convinced that this was not a dream, thanked them profusely and vowed to be the best possible Junior Novice Laureate.

That was the last time we saw Don.

The group had been meeting for centuries raising the good writers and eliminating the bad.  This assignment had been a real pain in the ass.  The group was part of that Great Group of Awesome Authors and had been sent to eliminate some would be author named Don Heller to avoid any more bad writing.  They were instructed to join Heller's Creative Writing class for eight weeks, easily the most unpleasant task the group had ever had to confirm his elimination.  Frank the Great Curmudgeon was their leader, Andy. Beth and Elaine were his Acolytes.  Bud was an Acolyte Emeritus, Tiffany was still a Neophyte Acolyte and was continually distracted by her frogs. The group met and talked of the best way to dispatch Heller and help to purify the profession.  They were still talking when Heller arrived, they instructed Tiffany to put him under a spell until they could decide the best way to end his career.  Frank argued that drowning was the best alternative, Andy and Beth argued for mercy but Frank prevailed and it was decided to drown him.

That was the last time we saw Don, he was slipping under the water with a frog on his head.

<br/>

Don was teaching a Creative Writing course at Millersville University.  The class was middle age except for one guy who was really old and one young woman with, would you believe green hair. It was a really good experience and enjoyed by all.  The group had bonded quickly in spite of the various backgrounds. One night toward the end of the term Andy received a call from Don's wife, Jane.  Don had described him as a very kind sympathetic person when he was describing the class to her.  Andy told us later how she had become very upset and almost incoherent.  She started yelling that she thought Don might be messing around with that Marcy and if that was true she would remove his manhood, she also said that if he thought he was so god damned romantic he should save some of it for home and get back on his Viagra.  Andy talked with her and told her that it could be good for the class to talk to him in view of their various experiences.  They agreed and Andy contacted the class.  The class agreed to talk with Don, and then with the couple at a picnic at the end of the class.

Frank led the discussion, his insight, experience and advise were outstanding.  Elaine's advice made the rest of the group blush but it was equally valuable, Andy and Beth provided valuable insight, they had previously asked Bud and Tiffany not to talk, they were too old and too young.

We heard later that the advice was a great help and that Don and his wife went on to a long and happy marriage.   

That was the last time we saw Jane, and Don.
