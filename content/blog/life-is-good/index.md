SNAFU.

Life is Good, I am sitting in my Den with my dog gazing out the window surrounded by my books and my TV, it is snowing outdoors but we have a blazing fire.

Today is Veterans day, my thoughts go back many years to when I was drafted in to the Army.  I was awarded the World War II Victory Medal and the Japanese Occupation Medal. I did not receive the Good Conduct Medal.  I am embarrassed to be included with all of the heroes.  The Army needed me to take up space in Japan and to replace our heroes who deserved to be home.

My classmates and I knew all through High School that we would almost certainly end-up in the service.   We would be leaving our family and friends, on to Basic Training with dreaded Drill Sargent's, running ten miles and hiking thirty with heavy packs and shipping off to strange places, scary.  We were a bunch of na√Øve kids from Central Pennsylvania about to go all over the Globe.  

My service started when I received a letter to report for a physical at a warehouse a couple of weeks after my Eighteenth Birthday.  

I was working in a survey crew that were all veterans, they could not stop laughing when I told them that I was being drafted, not encouraging.

Two weeks later I took a bus to the warehouse, walked up the steps concerned, worried.  There was a less than attractive lady at the top of the steps in a white coat covered with blood taking samples.  She was outside because all the draftees were naked.  My turn came later.  We went from line to line, this is where I first learned to stand in line, they told us "say aah," "take a deep breath," "bend over and spread your cheeks," "do you like girls"?  After the lines they told us "go home, we will notify you."  My life was going to change, but how?

I received another letter in a few days telling me to show up at that goddamn warehouse for Induction in two weeks.  I said my good- byes including to my girlfriend who I later found out started dating my best friend the week I left.

What did they do when they inducted you, where would they send me, what would I do, it was walking off in to the unknown, lots of luck Bud.

Back at the warehouse, "Get in line." "Step forward," after a moment, "You are in the Army."  Then an offer, "You can join the Regular Army and get out in 18 months or stay a draftee and probably be in much longer," this was the first Army lie among many, many more.  I opted for the Regular Army to be sure to be able to start college the next Fall.  They sent those of us volunteered for the Regular Army home and told us to come back tomorrow.  What a letdown. "Hi mom, I'm not leaving until tomorrow," I stayed in the house too embarrassed to be seen.

Tomorrow back at the warehouse.  Thank God, a handful of my High School buddies were there, it would be us against them for 18 months.  "Get in line, we are going to the Rail Road station."  We passed a few veterans, all laughing and shouting "you'll be sorry," we would hear that refrain a thousand times.  We boarded the train, Soldiers following a tradition of heroes looking forward to great adventures.  Not so, we were a bunch of kids who "didn't know shit."  

Camp Meade, the Induction Center, half a dozen shots, sick, physicals, interviews, uniforms, standing in line, cadre shouting at you, after a few days off to the dreaded Basic.  

Basic was less challenging than my Boy Scout Troop. Our Platoon Sargent charged five dollars for a week-end pass and that was almost the only time we saw him. Ordnance School was next, we learned to repair obsolete Anti-Aircraft Gun Directors, then to Camp Kilmer for our overseas assignment and then thirty-eight miserable days on a troop ship to Japan, from Brooklyn.

Japan was exciting and strange at first, the country was devastated and the people were poor. I was assigned to a base in Tokyo, work was easy, the Gooks\* did everything except make my bed, I missed home.   
After 8 months I sailed back to Seattle and was discharged.

The GIs invented a word during WWII, Snafu -- Situation Normal, All Fucked Up.  I thought it was worst when we were in the Army, we had just come off a global war and were gearing down to a much smaller Regular Army but GIs were famous for bitching, me included.

I have mixed feelings about my time in the Army, I did not change the Army and I don't think it changed me.  There were times I had a lot of fun, made a lot of friends, travelled, matured, but all in all a waste of time. They gave me the GI Bill\*\* and that made us even.

\* I know that "Gook" is politically incorrect and offensive, I haven't used the term in seventy years but I did then<br/>

\*\* A four-year scholarship to any School.
