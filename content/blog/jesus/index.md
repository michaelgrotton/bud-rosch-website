<br/>

Not all heroes are famous.

Mine is un-famous.

Few know Jesus,

Not sure God does.

Born under a cloud,

Cloud kept growing.

Dirty, sweaty, smelly,

Small, stumpy

And Brown.

His face is lined,

He needs a shave.

<br/>

Born in a hovel,

Father a drunk,

Mother a whore.

Ten siblings,

Makes you strong,

Or kills you.

<br/>

Met Maria,

Had a baby,

No wedding,

No money.

More babies,

Everyone hungry,

Jumped the fence.

Broke the law!

<br/>

Got a job,

Sun up to Sundown

Six days a week,

One hundred degrees,

Mostly more,  

Following the harvest

It's called farm labor.

<br/>

Lousy pay.

Boss screws him,

Can't complain,

Undocumented.

<br/>

Family hungry,

Money to home,

Can't go back,

Might get caught,

Jail or deport,

Every one starves.

<br/>

Wakes bone tired,

Hungry

Afraid of the law,

Getting older,

Family needs him,

Has to work.

<br/>

He smiles,

He's friendly,

Cheerful,

People like him,

He will work tomorrow,

And all the tomorrows

Dirty, sweaty, smelly,

Bone tired.

<br/>

Until he dies.

<br/>

Courage makes a hero,

Courage is Jesus.
