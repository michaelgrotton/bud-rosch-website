I just had one of those Out Of Body Experiences, Wow.  It happened when I was coming out of the anesthetic after my operation.

I found myself on a city street with signs pointing to the Entrance and proceeded to follow the signs.  After a while I came to a large sign across the street, WELCOME TO HEAVEN, GOD.  There were numerous direction signs, Sign In, Information, Restaurant and even Rest Rooms, it reminded me of Disneyland except there was no Admission charge.

The Information building seemed like the best place to start, when I entered the office, it looked like any other office except that the pretty girl behind the counter had large wings. She showed me a map of the various areas, it is a big place, described the various services and told me what I would have to do to enter Heaven.  The first thing would be to sign in, that could take a few days because I would have to describe all of my good and bad deeds.  I would be able to stay free at the local Blue Sky Hotel noted for it's Soul Food.  After Sign-in I would have to go to Orientation, that would require a few days and then to Application for Entry which could take weeks.  Heaven is a bureaucracy?  I asked about the wings, she said that would be covered at Orientation.

Completing the Sign-in was difficult, my Bads exceed my Goods and it seemed prudent to present myself in the best possible light, I thought this would determine my entrance and possibly have something to do with the wings and maybe a halo or a harp.

My Sign-in must have met the Entrance standard and I was sent to Orientation.  At Orientation we were provide with a large manual and introduced to our Mentor.  My Mentor was formidable, he had very large wings and a gold halo and was friendly.

The Mentor explained that Heaven was a happy place but unique, everything is virtual, if you see your Dad, he sees his Son but his Father sees him as his Son and he sees his Father as his Father, complicated.  All of a sudden his wings fell off and I heard "how are you feeling".
