This collection of essays is from an exercise called Januwordy that was suggested by my Grandson Ian.  Januwordy lists a word prompt writing challenge for each day. Ian suggested that we do the half-marathon, write every other day.  I agreed to the challenge and labored through with some delays towards the end.  It was sometimes hard work and tedious.  Ian, the dog just did the first two and dropped out.  His effort is included with my collection and are quite good.  Ian's talent and lack of persistence compare to my persistence and lack of talent.

The Prompt for each of the essays is noted in the parentheses after each title.  There are no rules for the essays, the writer incorporates the word in to the story and writes about anything that he/she selects.  It generally took me four to six hours to write and edit the stories.  The stories need more editing but I did not want to spend any more time on the exercise.

These stories open me up to examination on a personal level more than I like.  It suggests; that I hate Trump, I am a liberal and an Eagles fan, I have health problems and I am happy and love my family and that I am an Agnostic or Atheist and think about old age. My family and friends probably know those attitudes already.

I would be interested in any of your comments if you happen to read my stories.  I should note that there may be inaccuracies, prejudices and exaggerations.
