This would be easily the worst day in George Babbitt's life.  He woke at eight, it was a miserable day, sleet was hitting the window, the drive in town would be difficult.  He had always spent his waking hour reveling in how good life is, but not lately.  Diarrhea, nausea, a pounding headache and a terrible depression were a daily experience.  George was in the middle of his mid-life crisis.  The day would become even worse.  

Last month George had met a client, an attractive divorcee named Tanis Junique who put a move on him.  George was a flirt, until now nothing had ever happened.  This time he let himself slide into a relationship that escalated into an affair and also into heavy drinking and promiscuous behavior with the local party animals every single night in spite of his daily promise to himself to stop drinking.  He was now in the habit of drinking to cure his hangover and even hid a bottle of whiskey in his desk.  His hands shook so badly he could hardly hold the bottle.  All of this started when his wife Myra had left town to care for her sister who had become ill.

It was a week after Myra's return, George came down to breakfast feeling as bad as he had ever felt.  He mumbled a curt "good morning", took a mouthful of coffee, which upset his stomach even more and hurried to the door.  Myra called "Wait Georgie", he was hardly thinking but he did realize that Myra had never called him Georgie and that it had in fact been Tanis' endearment.  He never the less continued to the door when Myra shouted, "Come back here or you will rue the day that you did not".  George could hardly bear to think but something in Myra's voice made him return.

"Sit down George, I want to talk to you about your behavior and how it is going to change."  Myra had never talked to George in such a forceful manner.  His stomach churned until he thought he would vomit; he wanted to leave but was starting to fear what might be coming.  "George, remember Hank Aron the divorce lawyer that you disliked so much?  I have hired Hank and he has hired a private detective who in turn hired a photographer.  They have dozens of pictures of you and Tanis and those other tramps; I can't believe the things that you have done.  Another thing, do not think of shooting me the way Paul shot Zilla, Hank will provide the District Attorney with the pictures and you would be in the Electric Chair in 60 days"  

 Imagine how George must have felt, this was unbelievable, the hangover, the depression, he could hardly think and Myra who had been the meek docile wife for twenty years was threatening to destroy him.  He felt helpless, he was.

Myra started to talk, "George, we have some new rules, one, you are never to speak to or associate yourself with Tanis or anyone else in that crowd, not even to say good-by.  Number two, you are not to drink without my approval and only when I am there, and forget those stinking cigars.  Number three, you are to respect me and honor my wishes and that is the most important rule."

George was stunned.  His whole world was collapsing, he thought he might be dreaming but knew he was not.  Myra continued, "You realize what will happen if you do not agree to the new rules.  The Zenith Journal will have a new sensational photograph of you for the next 12 weeks, I will sue you for divorce, you will be penniless, my father will fire you, the children will hate you, and the Booster Club will roast you for months.  There is no negotiation."

For a while people talked of how George had changed.  He was as kind and helpful as a Boy Scout, his behavior was beyond reproach.  He attended church each Sunday and eventually became President of the Booster Club.  He was an ideal father and spent many hours with the children who all became the ideal citizen that was their father.

What the world did not know, and never would have believed was what happened to the Babbitt's romance.  For some unknown reason, Myra stumbled on to S&M while visiting her sister and convinced George to try it.  Imagine Myra chasing George around the house with hand-cuffs and a whip.  They loved it.
