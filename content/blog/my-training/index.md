<br/>

I have a trainer,<br/>
To make me strong,<br/>
His biggest challenge,<br/>
Reputation in peril.<br/>
Training at Fortius,<br/>
Dutch for strength.<br/>

We do reps,<br/>
Always ten reps,<br/>
Not nine, not eleven,<br/>
Don't know why.<br/>

First, hang by my arms,<br/>
Like a crucifixion except no nails.<br/>
KNEES UP, crunch, hard.<br/>

Then squats, I excel,<br/>
They want a picture,<br/>
Embarrassing,<br/>
Looks like I'm doing<br/>
You know what.<br/>

Next push- ups and pull-ups<br/>
Pinch those blades,<br/>
PINCH THOSE BLADES,<br/>
Who needs strong blades?<br/>

Lunges are next,<br/>
Front, back and sideways,<br/>
Look like a fish out of water,<br/>
Flop left, flop right, up and down.<br/>
"Left foot behind left foot,<br/>
Keep your posture,<br/>
Take a break   (dummy)."<br/>

Then throw a ten pound ball<br/>
Against the wall,<br/>
Backwards,<br/>
Ten times.<br/>
Makes you strong.<br/>
