She kept saying, "What's your secret, what's your secret".

I am in the "older than 85 classification of citizens".  The only thing I did to get in that classification is to arrive in 1927, I have been told it was late on a stormy night.

Being ninety, I am actually ninety-one gives one a notoriety, no one pays any attention to eighty-nine but when they see ninety and I am somewhat normal they say "wow".

Yesterday I was volunteering at Hospice when an older guy came rushing up to me, I had previously talked to him and said, "are you ninety", "yeah, I'm 91", I don't feel like ninety", "nor do I".  After a slight hesitation, "I feel like 70", "me to".  That started a pleasant conversation.  His daughter had told him that he was to old to go to Europe, he said he used to go every year.  We confronted her daughter who claimed she only referred to the 75 years old limit on car rentals licenses.  Sounds like he might go after all, there are obviously tours and public transformations.

A few months ago, I broke my toe and was sitting in a waiting room when a doctor came in and quickly turned around and left.  He came in and asked later if I was really ninety, he thought the girls made a mistake.  Presumably he did not think I was 90 years old when he entered the waiting room.

There was also the Flight Attendant who addressed me while waiting for the door to open and said, "Hon, can I get you a wheel chair".  A young girl asked me if I want help lifting my bag.  Devastating.  I lifted 250 pounds at a recent competition.  Not everyone thinks I look alive.

I was recently in for a routine test and the nurse asked to you take any medications, I replied "No", she replied, "Noooooo", this happens all the time.  Then she asked, "what is your secret for staying so healthy and active.  "I don't know, I used to drink a lot and smoked 2 or three packs of Camels" (I stopped both 40 years ago).  She persisted, "What is your secret".

I don't know any secret for aging unless it is Good Luck.
