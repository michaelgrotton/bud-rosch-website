There are times in one's life when the stars align for Times To Remember.  When I graduated from High School; got a job, joined the Army, went to Japan, and started college was one of those times.

My greatest Time to Remember climaxed when Judy, my wife said "get me some chewing gum".  I never saw her with chewing gum, in fact I thought she sort of disapproved of it.  

This is how the Time started.  I moved to Massachusetts.  Not too long after that I started dating Judy, proposed and married her.  Our first year was a delight, we floated along, "everything came up roses".  Then life changed, and I mean it really changed, forever.

We were getting ready for bed, Judy was in the bathroom and cried, I think my water broke, get me some gum.  I panicked, an understatement, "we don't have any gum, what should we do, should we go to the hospital, I'll get the car".  "No wait", "Are you sure", finally "I'll get the car".  

I still remember standing in the hall, panicked, bewildered, scared, what a poor husband I was.  I ran for the car, fell on the ice, drove to the door and got Judy.  Judy was also scared, she had a right to be.  It was late, there was hardly any traffic, I don't think either of us said anything.  We were going to a new place, we did not know what it would be like but we knew it would be big, mostly wonderful and it was and I am still a little scared.

We entered a small lobby, a woman put Judy in a wheel-chair, said "We will call you later"  and took my wife away.  I was all alone.  The time has never passed so slowly, minute by minute, no one else in the lobby, no information.

It was five or six hours later when there was a call, "your wife just had a baby girl, you can see her shortly".  The biggest deal in my whole life and that was all they had to say.  In a few minutes the elevator door opened and there was Judy on a gurney, smiling.  I was truly overcome with love and filled with a lot of other emotions and excitement.  They closed the door in a couple of minutes and said "come back later", there I was, alone again.

I was so happy, elated and excited that I did not know what to do.  I was walking on air.  It was dawn, there was no one else to share my joy.  I decided on morning Mass to give thanks, and I was truly thankful.  

The rest is a blur.

The stars are still aligned, it's truly been a Time To Remember and it continues. The memories return and return and are alive again. Tears still come in to my eyes as I write "your wife just had a little baby girl".
