I am or was an Engineer.  Most Engineers are primarily concerned with physical problems and do not consider the abstract, and I was one of them.  We studied Math and Physics and Chemistry and their application to the environment.

Now that I am retired, I have time to consider the other side of life.  I wonder about Belief, is that the driver in our life, does it guide all our decisions.  Emergency decisions obviously cannot be controlled by our beliefs, no time to decide what to do when you see a ball coming at your head, you duck. The ball was coming at you because you were playing baseball and that could have been because you believed that sports and baseball were good.  The "informed" decisions seem to be the thing that guides us, the religious would say that God does, some Biologists maintain that our brain is an Algorithm and every action is programmed.

It has been 75 years since I was an Eagle scout. The Scout Oath was one of our beliefs and guides, I recited it many times but I had to Google it to refresh my memory. It would be interesting to review it and see if I have honored it.

> ## On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and Country, to obey the Scout Law, to help other people and to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight. ##

</br>

The Oath comes back to me.  Some of it seems vague but it is certainly good guidance.  To be honorable used to be really important but that does not seem to be the case today.  The law starts with the statement that a Scout has honor and will follow the oath based on his honor. "To do my best to do my duty to God and Country."  I am not sure what duty to God is, I suppose that meant to be an active member of a church, I am no longer a church member. I lost that one.  I think I am OK with "duty to Country," I served in the army, kept the laws and volunteered for civic activities.  I'll cover the laws below.  "To help other people," I think that is important, I tried hard.  I think I am also OK with "physically strong," I am not sure what "mentally awake and morally straight" means but I am OK with it.

> ## A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent. ##

</br>

I claim to be Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, and Courteous.  I am not sure about Obedient, I have become more questioning and cynical, I am only obedient when I think it is required, or I have to be obedient, like in the army.  I also claim to be Cheerful, Brave and Clean.  I am not Thrifty, I should be but alas.  The Scouts define Reverent "as to be reverent to God, be faithful in your religious duties".  "Respect the belief of others".  I do not believe in God or have a religion, I am good for respect of others.

I think that, considering where I am and where I have been, I have stayed with these beliefs and will give myself an A.
