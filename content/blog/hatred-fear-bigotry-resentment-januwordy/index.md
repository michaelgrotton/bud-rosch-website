President Donald J. Trump has unleashed a torrent of hatred, fear, bigotry and resentment among his followers, the Rural, Evangelicals, Catholics and Non-College Educated that is tearing this country apart.

I am sympathetic to the Non-College Educated particularly those between the coasts, America has left them behind.  Seventy years ago, these people could expect a job where only one person in the family had to work, the Unions provided good benefits and they could look forward to a comfortable retirement.  Today, American business has shifted most manufacturing work overseas to much lower paying jobs and has not rewarded their workers with a fair share of company profits for those jobs that have not gone overseas.  I see no recourse for the non-college educated except for a guaranteed minimum wage, unfortunately that is years away if ever.

Most of the Rural are religious conservatives who have traditionally voted Republican. There seems to be an inherent dislike of outsiders and Trump has increased that dislike by his false claims that the Mexicans are all rapists and murderers invading the country.  Trump inflames these feelings with his mid-west rallies and lies.

The Catholic Church and many Catholics seem only concerned with abortion. They overlook all of Trumps disgusting and demeaning personal characteristics, over eight-thousands lies, adultery, multiple marriages, multiple bankruptcies and stiffing contractors.  Trump's hawkish foreign policy could lead us to war and a nuclear holocaust, not what Jesus preached.  I remember that we were taught peace and purity by the Sisters, how can that church support Trump to gain control over women's choice.

I save most of my disgust for the hypocritical "What would Jesus do" evangelicals.  They loudly proclaim the Biblical teachings but enthusiastically support a lying, cheating, crude demagogue to gain religious power. They should go to the hell they proclaim for others.

Trumps time in office will end, the good people that support him will come to see that our country is being destroyed and will help remove him from office.  The rest of us will have to work that that day comes sooner. Those so inclined should pray to their God that He finds a position in Hell for Trump.
