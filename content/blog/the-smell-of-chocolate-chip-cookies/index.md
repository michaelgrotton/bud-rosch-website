The smell of Chocolate chip cookies comes wafting down the Hospice In-patient unit corridor meeting and comforting the families and guests.  Most patients come to the in-patient unit to die, it is a place of death.  Chocolate Chip Cookies poke Death in the eye, we are not afraid to enjoy cookies just like we do where death does not abide.  

I have been making chocolate chip cookies most Wednesdays at Hospice for twenty years.  Older women are particularly suspicious, "did you make these?", "yeah"," from scratch?", "sure", a reluctant, "they are very good".  They are very good, they should be after twenty years although I am still working for perfection.  Cookies must look good, three inches in diameter, a half inch high at the center and just the right shade of light brown, this takes careful preparation of the batter so that it is light and fluffy.  When you bite the cookie, you should hear and feel the crisp outside and savor the soft center with pockets of chocolate, that requires cooking for exactly fourteen minutes, and then there is the aroma and the taste. Vanilla is the secret to great cookies, when preparing the batter, you start pouring vanilla like you forgot to stop.  Thank you, Martha Stewart.

I respect death, I feed the dying, I bathe the dying, I visit with the dying but life goes on.  There are times when it is appropriate to offer cookies and ice cream, patients smile and have a moment of fun, there is also the time when a patient wants only peace, not some old volunteer bothering them.

The staff at Hospice are exceptional for their caring and skill but they are content going about a difficult and rewarding job.  I have never known so many nice people in one place.  Baking cookies is extra fun because many of the staff look forward to a Wednesday cookie and it gives me a chance to talk with them. We are careful to provide cookies first to the patients where they are welcome and allowed, they go fast.

Making someone happy with a cookie is rewarding, it is even better to make ice cream sandwiches, every so often a patient's eyes will widen and she will smile with the thought of an ice cream sandwich.  Consider, these are patients who face death, all of their concerns disappear for a short time with the taste of cookies and ice cream.

At age ninety I am possibly more qualified to speak of death, I sometimes see her peaking around the corner. I will want cookies and ice cream when I am a patient.
