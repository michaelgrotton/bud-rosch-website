They were a bunch of crazy kids heading for they knew not where but they were not the least bit afraid, conceived at the end of the Roaring Twenties, greeted with joy, then they were another mouth to feed, they lived with hand-me downs and not too many toys and few vacations.  For them, being poor was normal and they were happy with what they had.

They were just starting in to their Teens and the War started.  All of a sudden everyone had a job, even some of their mothers and jobs that adults normally occupied were available to them at good money.  Their parents had little patience for misbehavior during the Depression when they were worried about buying food and paying the rent and now, they were busy trying to keep house and work.  Besides some food being rationed, there was gas rationing and that put a damper on too much fooling around.

Another damper on too much misbehavior was some of their upper-class school mates were being killed in action and they knew that when they turned eighteen, they would be in uniform in a couple of months.

It was right after the end of the war and these kids had just been drafted and inducted.  Truth be told, they did not know shit.  Their education was modest, there was no TV, the local paper was also modest, they had not travelled and South-Central Pennsylvania was Republican Conservative.

A letter from President Truman said "you are in, report for induction".  After a scattered physical, "do you like girls", "bend over", they were sent home and recalled two weeks later.  "Step one foot forward, you are in the Army".  They were lined up and marched to the Rail-Road station, the discharged veterans along the way saying "You'll be sorry", they thought it was the funniest thing they had ever seen.  "You'll be sorry" was a refrain they would hear for the next few years.

On the train, full of inductees, "where we going"," I don't know", finally Fort Meade. Guys in uniform yelling at you, getting uniforms, eating in a mess hall, tests, interviews and in a few days, they arrived at their assignments.

The yelling and hollering and bantering and goofing-off would continue. They finished Basic and School and some went to Japan or Germany on a Troop Ship and they won a medal for "Occupying".

After a year or so they were sent home and discharged.  In exchange for goofing around and being bored they were given four years of college that changed their life.  A really good deal.

They had only changed a little, a little more worldly a little less na√Øve, a little more mature and happier to be home again.
