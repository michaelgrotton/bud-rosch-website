Website built for Bud Rosch (my grapndpa) with Gatsby.js!

check out gatsby here: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/

I used the gatsby blog starter, but made the following changes:
  * redesigned the ui with native css
  * implemented a tagging and filtering system for posts/pieces
  * deployed to netlify with live updates
